      <description>Hi,
I took some notes at the phonics screening meeting this evening - I thought they might be useful to share with the whole class group via email.
The teachers are going to circulate the powerpoint slides from the meeting and some examples of the words they will have to read,
 Phonics Screening is a national &amp;lsquo;test&amp;rsquo; that takes place in Year 2 in the second week in June.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We would like to invite you to a short meeting at 6-6:30 pm on Wednesday the 25th of April regarding the statutory Year 1 phonics screening which will take place in early June. We plan to meet in the Drama Studio at the bottom of the large tower block.
At the meeting we will outline the nature of the the screening program and suggest ways that you can support your child with their phonics.</description>
