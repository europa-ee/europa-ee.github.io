      <description>Dear year 3 parents,
In case of school closure please find attached a research project which we usually carry out over the Easter holidays in the lead up to our trip to Beale Park. Whilst the trip may not now happen, as nothing can be assured at this time, it would be good for the children to have a chance to carry out this research.
This research will be used after the scheduled Easter holidays to put together a presentation in both the stream language and English.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
Please find attached the plans and resources for the English part of the coming week with 3EE.
Expect your child to come home with maths workbooks which should be brought back into school Mon-Wed each week and remain at home the rest of the time. Although they are heavy A4 books it means if the school is suddenly closed or you have to self isolate then you have the main resources for our maths lessons.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents
This week 3EE will have PSHE lessons exploring bereavement, giving children a space to pause and reflect and to ask questions. I have attached the lesson resources we will be using so that if your child is absent you have the opportunity to explore this area with them at home. The resource is taken from Child bereavement UK.
If your child would rather not be in these lessons please let me know - I have timetabled them for a time when Louise, our TA, is with us.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
In case schools are asked to close by the UK government we are making contingency plans as a school. As part of this it would be helpful to know if your child/children have access to a tablet or computer that they can use to access virtual lessons (most likely to be done via google hangouts) and can access set tasks and submit their work via google classroom. Please email Sofia and I if your children do not have a computer or tablet that they can use at home.</description>

      <description>Dear year 3 parents,
Our cake sale is coming up on Thursday and Friday next week, we&#39;ve put up posters and got our baking tins out in preparation. In order that the bus children in year 3 do not miss out on their own cake sale we would like to invite them to bring in £1 and choose a cake on Thursday 5th March, children not travelling on the bus may also do this if it is more convenient for you.</description>

      <description>Dear year 3 parents,
We are very pleased we were able to book an extra trip this term to visit Narnia at Dorchester Abbey. With 3EE going on Tuesday 3rd March, 3DE on Wednesday 4th March and 3FE going on the 5th March it should be a great experience for all. However, because it is an extra trip we need to cover a shortfall in the costs by raising some money through a year 3 cake sale.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
We have been very lucky to have Ernest Guevarra come in each Monday to teach the children basketball as one of their PE lessons. As the children will all too soon be starting swimming as a second PE lesson, we are nearing the end of these basketball sessions. Many of the children have really developed their skills and enjoy playing the sport. If they would like to continue with this interest there is a link here to basketball clubs in Oxfordshire which you could pursue with your child: https://www.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
This Tuesday afternoon we are planning to build 3D maps of Narnia to help us both in planning and writing our own adventure story in Narnia but also to assist us in learning mapping techniques. We will aim to build a 3D map, turn it into a 2D map and use it as inspiration for our own Narnia stories. If you and your children are able to help by lending Lego and base boards on Tuesday and Wednesday this week (11th and 12th February) that would be great.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
Please find attached the spelling lists for the year. Each Monday we will test we will test 10 common exception words and 10 words which follow the spelling rule for that week. Some weeks the rule is &amp;lsquo;common exception words&amp;rsquo; so the children will have an additional 10 CE words which are listed in the table and stuck in their homework books. Due to an error made last term we will test aut week 5 and 6 words when we would expect to do spr week 5 and 6.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
This term’s maths workbooks should have come home today with your child as we no longer need them in school (we are moving onto the next term’s workbook). Please do not be alarmed that they are not completely filled in and some lessons appear to be missed - this is in part because they are designed for schools who have 5 maths lessons in English each week. It is also because we use other resources to carry out investigations and work on understanding concepts so not everything is recorded in this workbook.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
If you would like your child to borrow a glockenspiel overnight to practise for our Christmas concert please email me to confirm this and I will allow them to take it home. It must be returned the next day so that other children can have a chance to borrow it in turn. Also we need ALL the glockenspiels in school for rehearsing as we will be doing a short practice each day and there are only just enough for one between two children.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
It was lovely to see so many of you yesterday for parents evening. On the back of our discussions I will be adjusting the spelling tests a little so that they have two short tests of 10 words each. The second test will be 10 randomly selected spellings from the list they stick in each week. These lists follow particular spelling rules. However as many children need to secure the foundations of their spellings this year the first short test of 10 words will be common exception words (those words which crop up regularly in reading and writing and often do not follow easy phonic patterns).</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
The children&#39;s English maths challenge this year for homework is to learn their times tables facts and related division facts. Hopefully Times Tables Rockstars has proved helpful for some, if you would like some non-screen options there are plenty of card game sets available with the question on one side and answer on the other. We even made our own individual sets for 4x and divide by 4 in class.</description>

There will be a few chairs outside to wait on.

As yet we have no class reps, this is a shared role and could be shared I am sure between more than two people but without any reps it will make raising money for the class at the Christmas fair and organising other events quite tricky. It doesn&#39;t need to be a big role, make of it what you choose but it would be really helpful to have some reps.</description>

Thanks so much to all of you who were able to join us this afternoon for our class party. The children loved having you there to see their song and film. As promised, here is the link to the beautiful film the children made: https://spark.adobe.com/video/LxWTNfe6VfFCJ
Do ask them about their assembly which they performed in front of the whole of KS1 today - it was great.
Thanks too for the really moving &amp;quot;Inspiring Jar&amp;quot; you gave me.</description>

We certainly packed in the fun this week at school. Your children proudly read the books they had written to 1EE yesterday. They rehearsed their assembly about the rainforest, which they will perform next week.
This morning they wrote another book, working with a story teller from the Oxford Story Museum. Ask them about the story she taught them with a giant and a secret. They may be able to remember the whole thing.</description>

Thank you! The Fun Run this morning was wonderful thanks to your support for your children.
This week the children learnt how to whittle willow in Forest Schools. They made infinity tiles and finished their wonderful fiction books which they will be reading to 1EE next week. They made their own model of &amp;ldquo;values which they would choose to hold up their life like pillars&amp;rdquo; – inspired by the five pillars of Islam.</description>

This week they learnt about the water cycle and made three kinds of clouds. They wrote wonderful stories, created cubes with matchsticks, lay in the orchard and used their senses to make journey sticks.</description>

We had a wonderful day today celebrating our international links. The children made complex flags showing all the different countries they felt connected with. They found the countries on a map and made a collaborative jigsaw of the whole world.</description>

It has been great to see the children again this week. In Forest Schools they made elder necklaces and in English they wrote about a special place. They thought up questions about our new topic of the weather. They played coins, gave change for cakes and learnt how to answer word questions in Maths. In RE we started to explore Islam as our third religion this year.

They held a northern white faced owl called “Quintessa” and learnt that owls have different coloured eyes depending on when they hunt. Please find photos attached (the app has duplicated some, apologies).
Today they planted sunflower seeds – one for Mum and one for themselves as a gift for Mother’s on Sunday’s UK Mother’s day.</description>

This week the children have planted cress and set up a test to see if water and light affect its growth. They have explored fractions of amounts, painted symmetrical butterfly wings and turned shapes clockwise and anticlockwise. They have written their Mai Ling story and explored chromatography in forest schools.
Next week we are looking forward to going to see the birds in Millets Falconry on Thursday. The trip will leave school at 10.</description>

We had a great World Book Day filled week this week and the children all developed their own imaginary characters, which they illustrated and described for the school Book Day competition. They planted beans to grow hydroponically on the window and identified plants in Forest Schools. In Maths, they played with fractions by folding paper and remembered that they are equal parts of a whole.
Next week is Science Week and we are looking forward to using microscopes and exploring animal behaviour with visitors.</description>

Forest School uses the outdoor environment to support children’s learning across the whole curriculum. The activities specifically follow and enhance the learning from inside the classroom, with a very hands-on approach.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Today we have sent home a reading comprehension book to your child as part of this week&#39;s homework. Please would you support your child in helping them read the first poem Big Red Boots on page 4 and answering the questions on page 5 as well as they can. This will be challenging for some children as it is a very formal lay out and asks them to answer specific questions.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We have had a great week with your bright children. I hope they tell you about some of the things they have learnt this week. Ask them about toasting marshmallows in Forest School, or writing instructions about how to make a sandwich &amp;hellip; and then making one. They can tell you about how c and g are scared of i,e and y. They may even be able to fill you in on how to find out the classes favourite sandwich - as a bar chart, or a tally.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Your children&#39;s work was shown in assembly today and I thought you might like to see it. Class 2EE made beautiful film riddles using their senses and lots of adjectives - they described two places in the school and challenged the other children to guess where they had been.

The teachers are going to circulate the powerpoint slides from the meeting and some examples of the words they will have to read,
  Phonics Screening is a national &amp;lsquo;test&amp;rsquo; that takes place in Year 1 in the second week in June.</description>
