      <description>Dear Parents,
This week’s words to learn are: 1. head 2. bread 3. meant 4. road 5. coat 6. coach 7. child 8. children 9. wild 10. climb
The first five words will remind the children that when &amp;ldquo;two vowels go together, the first one says its name&amp;rdquo;. The last five words are tricky words from the Year 2 list.
I am also attaching the fireworks poem which the children wrote this week.</description>

Re: Outdoor Learning in Year 2
Year 2 are being introduced to the principles of Forest School. We are lucky to have this facility on our site and a member of staff who has trained as a Forest school Leader.
Forest School uses the outdoor environment to support children’s learning across the whole curriculum. The activities specifically follow and enhance the learning from inside the classroom, with a very hands-on approach.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Today we have sent home a reading comprehension book to your child as part of this week&amp;rsquo;s homework. Please would you support your child in helping them read the first poem Big Red Boots on page 4 and answering the questions on page 5 as well as they can. This will be challenging for some children as it is a very formal lay out and asks them to answer specific questions.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We have had a great week with your bright children. I hope they tell you about some of the things they have learnt this week. Ask them about toasting marshmallows in Forest School, or writing instructions about how to make a sandwich &amp;hellip; and then making one. They can tell you about how c and g are scared of i,e and y. They may even be able to fill you in on how to find out the classes favourite sandwich - as a bar chart, or a tally.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Your children&amp;rsquo;s work was shown in assembly today and I thought you might like to see it. Class 2EE made beautiful film riddles using their senses and lots of adjectives - they described two places in the school and challenged the other children to guess where they had been.

      <description>Hi,
I took some notes at the phonics screening meeting this evening - I thought they might be useful to share with the whole class group via email.
The teachers are going to circulate the powerpoint slides from the meeting and some examples of the words they will have to read,
 Phonics Screening is a national &amp;lsquo;test&amp;rsquo; that takes place in Year 1 in the second week in June.</description>
