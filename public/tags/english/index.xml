      <description>Dear Parents,
Science week has been fun! The children used microscopes on Wednesday, assisted by a research scientist Oxford University. On Thursday they learnt about animal behaviour from Luca’s Mum and loved hearing about positive rewards helping rescue animals learn to behave. In Maths they have made 3D shapes and in English they have learnt how to tell the Chinese story of Mai Ling. Please do ask them to tell you the story.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Class 2EE had a great week this week, I hope they have already told you about the helicopter seeds they made to understand seed dispersal, plant art with cardboard pieces, measuring g, kg, ml and litres and writing about their magic gardens. We welcomed a new child to our class, Ariadne joined us just in time to celebrate her birthday.
Spellings this week are the “or” sound spelt as “a”.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Your children have written owl books, multiplied with arrays, painted with straws, laid footprint traps, explored habitats, learnt about Judaism and more this week. They’ve been busy!
On Thursday we visited the Library and the children were invited to take a book home. I have a list of the books they have borrowed. There is no pressure at all for the children to read the books, they may enjoy you reading to them or they may just want to dip in.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
The children have worked so hard this week I think we should not do a spelling test next week.
It was lovely to see some of you at the concert on Monday and on Wednesday evening. Many thanks for your generosity to Snr Ruiz and I - I have some very lovely presents to put under the tree.
Some of you asked me to send you a copy of the tricky words which your child should be able to spell by the end of the year in their own writing.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Your children have been a joy to teach this week. They have learned lots about how to make slime and how to choose which materials would be best for an umbrella or a bouncy ball. They have painted pine cones from the tree in forest schools and worked with clay in art. If you are cutting up pizzas ask them if fractions need to be equal. They know about halves, quarters and thirds … and quite a bit more.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents.
Your children have done amazingly again this week. You should be very proud of them. They have learned to use the bar model to find missing numbers in subtraction stories. They have made designs for 50 pound notes. They have researched scientists and made dens in the forest. And more. Please find attached a song which they are learning for the concert. It would be wonderful if they could secretly practice at home.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
The children had a fascinating time today playing with real money hot off the press from De La Rue.
  They have brought home a pencil made of old bank notes to show you. Tomorrow we will be enjoying testing out building with materials to see if they are waterproof in Forest Schools. Please do make sure that your child has suitable clothing. It will be cold and possibly wet Gloves, hats, warm coats and waterproof trousers are ideal.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
I thought you might like to see some pictures from the building work today. The children worked immensely hard responding to a brief, designing, budgeting, building, testing and adapting their houses. They learnt a lot about working in teams, keeping within a timeframe and learning from mistakes. I hope they mentioned it to you. They should be very proud of their hard work. Attached are two compilation photos, excuse the mix being a little rushed.</description>

Re: Outdoor Learning in Year 2
Year 2 are being introduced to the principles of Forest School. We are lucky to have this facility on our site and a member of staff who has trained as a Forest school Leader.
Forest School uses the outdoor environment to support children’s learning across the whole curriculum. The activities specifically follow and enhance the learning from inside the classroom, with a very hands-on approach.</description>

Today we have sent home a reading comprehension book to your child as part of this week&amp;rsquo;s homework. Please would you support your child in helping them read the first poem Big Red Boots on page 4 and answering the questions on page 5 as well as they can. This will be challenging for some children as it is a very formal lay out and asks them to answer specific questions.</description>

We have had a great week with your bright children. I hope they tell you about some of the things they have learnt this week. Ask them about toasting marshmallows in Forest School, or writing instructions about how to make a sandwich &amp;hellip; and then making one. They can tell you about how c and g are scared of i,e and y. They may even be able to fill you in on how to find out the classes favourite sandwich - as a bar chart, or a tally.</description>
