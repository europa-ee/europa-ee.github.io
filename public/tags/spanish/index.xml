      <description>Queridos padres de 1EE,
We are already in the fourth week of this period. And I think we are getting a good rhythm of learning. As 1EE teacher, I am following the same learning system like Senorita Maria Castro but with some modifications that I consider beneficial with working with children.
Every week I send home homework, between math exercises, reading with Letrilandia or yellow study notebook. I will try to send only one thing each week, because I consider that with the DVDs and a little bit of homework it is enough for the children.</description>
