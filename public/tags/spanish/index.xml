      <description>Dear parents and guardians,
Next week we will be working on the elaboration of some objects using some of the materials that we have studied in our science lessons (wood, plastic, cotton, wool, metal, stone, etc.). We will ask the children to make something using at least 3 different materials. Please help your children find something they can bring and maybe plan ahead in time what object they can make at school.</description>
