      <description>Dear Parents,
We certainly packed in the fun this week at school. Your children proudly read the books they had written to 1EE yesterday. They rehearsed their assembly about the rainforest, which they will perform next week.
This morning they wrote another book, working with a story teller from the Oxford Story Museum. Ask them about the story she taught them with a giant and a secret. They may be able to remember the whole thing.</description>
