      <p>Dear Parents,</p>

<p>The children have celebrated their wonderful hard work and creativity this term with a well-deserved jewel party today after bananas and chocolate cooked on the Forest School campfire. Thank you very much to all those parents who provided such wonderful party food for them.</p>

<p>As the Year 2 assessments come during the month of May, it would be great if you could gently support your child with some learning reminders in the holidays.  If you do have time, here are some options:</p>

<p>The spelling test on return from holidays will be taken from the Year 2 tricky words list.  Your child has a “fish” in their bag, which they can colour in as they spell the words with you to track their own progress and confidence.</p>

<p>In Maths, please play Matific with your child (user name: your child’s first name in lower case, followed by 2ee, password: unodos).  If you have time, please work through one of the SATs papers - from the link below - so that your child can explain to you how they would approach the questions.  Just a page at a time as a shared discussion with you would be great.  Please don’t make the child feel any sort of pressure, just show an interest in their own learning.  They are not aware from anything we have said in school that they will be “sitting SATs”.  So these should just be introduced as fun maths to share:

<p>There are lots of books on Bug Club which can be accessed at:
<a href="https://www.activelearnprimary.co.uk">https://www.activelearnprimary.co.uk</a>
I have updated all of the levels, please do use this resource which the school pays for each year.</p>

<p>If you have time to explore a reading comprehension with your child, they can be found at:

<p>Attached are just a few photos from the campfire today.</p>

<p>Wishing you a very happy holiday together.</p>

<p>Warmest wishes,</p>

<p>Liz Cook</p>
