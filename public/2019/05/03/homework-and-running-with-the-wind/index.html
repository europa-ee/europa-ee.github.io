      <p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>We have had fun this week making wind socks and weather vanes.  Your child should be able to tell you how wind is made and how we can measure it and find its direction.  In English we began to learn about the life of Beatrix Potter.   In Maths we made posters explaining our understanding of operations and the children showed off their wonderful Maths as a Birthday treat for M. Marechau.</p>
<p>For homework this week, please help your child to work through, orally and in pictures, as much of the rest of the Reasoning Maths 2018 as they are comfortable doing with you.  Enjoy them explaining their thinking to you in words or in pictures.  Many of them are getting pretty confident now about these concepts.  I have attached the paper just in case you do not have it still from last week.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your support for their learning.</p>
<p>Warmest wishes,</p>
<p>Liz Cook</p>
