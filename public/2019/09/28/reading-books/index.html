      <p>Dear parents</p>
<p>I think some parents have bought the books I mentioned. Thanks a lot for this, it is much appreciated and the children will benefit. It would be good to know what books the children have  as I would like to use them in the class with them.</p>
<p>For this reason I would appreciate if they could bring the book(s) they've got in to class with their names on them. We will read them in the class and they will read the same pages at home so I would prefer that they don't read the book(s) in advance.</p>
<p>The book Ricardo y el dinosaurio rojo, which is the first one can be read completely at home as we have nearly finished reading this one in class, and I will read to them the last few pages next week.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support.</p>
<p>Sofia</p>
