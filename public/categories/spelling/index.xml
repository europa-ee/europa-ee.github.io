      <description>Dear Parents.
Your children have done amazingly again this week. You should be very proud of them. They have learned to use the bar model to find missing numbers in subtraction stories. They have made designs for 50 pound notes. They have researched scientists and made dens in the forest. And more. Please find attached a [song](/audio/Follow that star (performance track) copy.mp3) which they are learning for the concert. It would be wonderful if they could secretly practice at home.</description>
