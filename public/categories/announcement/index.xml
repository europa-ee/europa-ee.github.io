      <description>Queridos padres de 1EE
We are only two weeks away from finishing this course, but we are still learning many things every day. I inform you that from today the children will send the finished work home being: red notebooks, the yellow notebook, math books and other work. So they are asked to take each day out of the blue backpack and stay home. In that way we avoid that the children do not arrive with a lot of weight at home.</description>
