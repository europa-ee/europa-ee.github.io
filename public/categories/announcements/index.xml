      <description>Hola a todos,
This week you can see in the yellow book two new pages:
 Song about &amp;ldquo;La se単orita Z&amp;rdquo; and picture of &amp;ldquo;La enfermera C&amp;rdquo;. This two letters have the same sound (like a snake), when Z goes with a, u, o and when C goes with e and i.
 Song about &amp;ldquo;La se単orita Z&amp;rdquo;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HZsQylt8xE

      <description>Hola a todos,
This week we have seen two new characters in Letrilandia which sounds the same in Spanish (b and v) the children are taking Letrilandia home to read them with you. (audio attached, pag 45 and 47).
In the yellow book you will see different words written with b and v, please try to write with them as last week you did with y and ll. You can read them again (y and ll) and continue reading until pag 51.</description>

      <description>Hola a todos,
This week I have sent in the yellow book words written with &amp;ldquo;y / ll&amp;rdquo;. Although they have the same sound your child should write them in the correct way. Read with them and you can ask them to write you different words on a paper. Another activity you can do is to read it to them and your child can find the picture or opposite (They read it to you and you can find the picture).</description>
