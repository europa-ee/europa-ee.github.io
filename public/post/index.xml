      <description>Dear year 3 parents,
In case of school closure please find attached a research project which we usually carry out over the Easter holidays in the lead up to our trip to Beale Park. Whilst the trip may not now happen, as nothing can be assured at this time, it would be good for the children to have a chance to carry out this research.
This research will be used after the scheduled Easter holidays to put together a presentation in both the stream language and English.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
Please find attached the plans and resources for the English part of the coming week with 3EE.
Expect your child to come home with maths workbooks which should be brought back into school Mon-Wed each week and remain at home the rest of the time. Although they are heavy A4 books it means if the school is suddenly closed or you have to self isolate then you have the main resources for our maths lessons.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents
This week 3EE will have PSHE lessons exploring bereavement, giving children a space to pause and reflect and to ask questions. I have attached the lesson resources we will be using so that if your child is absent you have the opportunity to explore this area with them at home. The resource is taken from Child bereavement UK.
If your child would rather not be in these lessons please let me know - I have timetabled them for a time when Louise, our TA, is with us.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
In case schools are asked to close by the UK government we are making contingency plans as a school. As part of this it would be helpful to know if your child/children have access to a tablet or computer that they can use to access virtual lessons (most likely to be done via google hangouts) and can access set tasks and submit their work via google classroom. Please email Sofia and I if your children do not have a computer or tablet that they can use at home.</description>

      <description>Dear year 3 parents,
Our cake sale is coming up on Thursday and Friday next week, we&#39;ve put up posters and got our baking tins out in preparation. In order that the bus children in year 3 do not miss out on their own cake sale we would like to invite them to bring in £1 and choose a cake on Thursday 5th March, children not travelling on the bus may also do this if it is more convenient for you.</description>

      <description>Dear year 3 parents,
We are very pleased we were able to book an extra trip this term to visit Narnia at Dorchester Abbey. With 3EE going on Tuesday 3rd March, 3DE on Wednesday 4th March and 3FE going on the 5th March it should be a great experience for all. However, because it is an extra trip we need to cover a shortfall in the costs by raising some money through a year 3 cake sale.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
We have been very lucky to have Ernest Guevarra come in each Monday to teach the children basketball as one of their PE lessons. As the children will all too soon be starting swimming as a second PE lesson, we are nearing the end of these basketball sessions. Many of the children have really developed their skills and enjoy playing the sport. If they would like to continue with this interest there is a link here to basketball clubs in Oxfordshire which you could pursue with your child: https://www.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
This Tuesday afternoon we are planning to build 3D maps of Narnia to help us both in planning and writing our own adventure story in Narnia but also to assist us in learning mapping techniques. We will aim to build a 3D map, turn it into a 2D map and use it as inspiration for our own Narnia stories. If you and your children are able to help by lending Lego and base boards on Tuesday and Wednesday this week (11th and 12th February) that would be great.</description>

      <description>Dear parents
This email has been sent to me from the PE teacher to pass on to all of you.
Dear parents,
Since the beginning of the school year I agreed that children could wear comfortable clothes on their PE day to avoid getting changed for PE. Nevertheless, they end up getting their trousers, socks and shoes quite wet and muddy during breaks, and consequently they end up bringing the dirt into the gym.</description>

Some weeks the rule is &amp;lsquo;common exception words&amp;rsquo; so the children will have an additional 10 CE words which are listed in the table and stuck in their homework books. Due to an error made last term we will test aut week 5 and 6 words when we would expect to do spr week 5 and 6.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
This term’s maths workbooks should have come home today with your child as we no longer need them in school (we are moving onto the next term’s workbook). Please do not be alarmed that they are not completely filled in and some lessons appear to be missed - this is in part because they are designed for schools who have 5 maths lessons in English each week. It is also because we use other resources to carry out investigations and work on understanding concepts so not everything is recorded in this workbook.</description>

If you would like your child to borrow a glockenspiel overnight to practise for our Christmas concert please email me to confirm this and I will allow them to take it home. It must be returned the next day so that other children can have a chance to borrow it in turn. Also we need ALL the glockenspiels in school for rehearsing as we will be doing a short practice each day and there are only just enough for one between two children.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
It was lovely to see so many of you yesterday for parents evening. On the back of our discussions I will be adjusting the spelling tests a little so that they have two short tests of 10 words each. The second test will be 10 randomly selected spellings from the list they stick in each week. These lists follow particular spelling rules. However as many children need to secure the foundations of their spellings this year the first short test of 10 words will be common exception words (those words which crop up regularly in reading and writing and often do not follow easy phonic patterns).</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
The children&#39;s English maths challenge this year for homework is to learn their times tables facts and related division facts. Hopefully Times Tables Rockstars has proved helpful for some, if you would like some non-screen options there are plenty of card game sets available with the question on one side and answer on the other. We even made our own individual sets for 4x and divide by 4 in class.</description>

I have just improved the set up of Times tables rockstars so that all pupils have the 2, 5, 10 and 3 x table questions available on their games. Please have a go on this website and see what you think - our free trial as a school ends in a week and we need to evaluate the service to see if it is a good idea for the school to subscribe.</description>

      <description>Dear 3EE parents,
As yet we have no class reps, this is a shared role and could be shared I am sure between more than two people but without any reps it will make raising money for the class at the Christmas fair and organising other events quite tricky. It doesn&#39;t need to be a big role, make of it what you choose but it would be really helpful to have some reps.</description>

Lastly, although dates are not confirmed yet we should be taking part in the following experiences and trips:

      <description>Dear parents
I think some parents have bought the books I mentioned. Thanks a lot for this, it is much appreciated and the children will benefit. It would be good to know what books the children have as I would like to use them in the class with them.
For this reason I would appreciate if they could bring the book(s) they&#39;ve got in to class with their names on them.</description>

      <description>Dear parents
I hope this email finds everyone well. As I mentioned at parents evening, for children that finish reading the class book quickly and would like to read a longer book, I would suggest some books from this website:
More difficult reading (8- 10 years old): link
Less difficult reading (6- 8 years old): link
They are really good as they have lots of activities and resources on the internet for each book.</description>

This year we will be working with some books to read in class and do some activities from. It would be good if they can continue reading them at home at the same time as it would help their comprehension and vocabulary.

The meeting itself will run from 5 until 5.45pm.

Apologies for a second email, please could we request the children to bring in a clear photo of themselves: headshots would be perfect but any picture where we can see their lovely faces is great. We would like to make a little display about ourselves to help all the staff who work with 3EE get to know the children quickly especially as we have a violin teacher and sports coach in addition to our 2 teachers and 2 TAs.</description>

It was lovely to meet the class last week, we are looking forward to getting to know them, and your good selves, over the forthcoming academic year.
You may be wondering &amp;quot;what&#39;s new for year 3?&amp;quot; Well thankfully, in terms of settling in, not too much. We have lunch a bit later which means a longer morning and shorter afternoon. Each week the class&amp;rsquo; music lesson involves learning string instruments (cello and violin) and if you agree to it the children can take the instruments home to practice with the help of an interactive music website.</description>

We certainly packed in the fun this week at school. Your children proudly read the books they had written to 1EE yesterday. They rehearsed their assembly about the rainforest, which they will perform next week.
This morning they wrote another book, working with a story teller from the Oxford Story Museum. Ask them about the story she taught them with a giant and a secret. They may be able to remember the whole thing.</description>

Thank you! The Fun Run this morning was wonderful thanks to your support for your children.
This week the children learnt how to whittle willow in Forest Schools. They made infinity tiles and finished their wonderful fiction books which they will be reading to 1EE next week. They made their own model of &amp;ldquo;values which they would choose to hold up their life like pillars&amp;rdquo; – inspired by the five pillars of Islam.</description>

This week they learnt about the water cycle and made three kinds of clouds. They wrote wonderful stories, created cubes with matchsticks, lay in the orchard and used their senses to make journey sticks.</description>

It has been great to see the children again this week. In Forest Schools they made elder necklaces and in English they wrote about a special place. They thought up questions about our new topic of the weather. They played coins, gave change for cakes and learnt how to answer word questions in Maths. In RE we started to explore Islam as our third religion this year.

I hope the children have already told you about the wonderful day we had yesterday at Millets Falconry. They held a northern white faced owl called “Quintessa” and learnt that owls have different coloured eyes depending on when they hunt. Please find photos attached (the app has duplicated some, apologies).
Today they planted sunflower seeds – one for Mum and one for themselves as a gift for Mother’s on Sunday’s UK Mother’s day.</description>

This week we have been learning about plants we eat during our science lessons. The children have been learning that we may eat either a root (carrot, beetroot,&amp;hellip;), a stem (celery, asparagus,&amp;hellip;), leaves (lettuce, spinach, &amp;hellip;), flowers (artichoke, coliflower, brocoli, &amp;hellip;), seeds (peas, beans, &amp;hellip;), etc.
We are planning to do a healthy snack lesson on Monday trying to combine all of these products in a green salad. We would appreciate if you could pack for your child some of these products in small ziplock bags or tupper, ideally chopped in long sticks or ready to eat.</description>

This week the children have planted cress and set up a test to see if water and light affect its growth. They have explored fractions of amounts, painted symmetrical butterfly wings and turned shapes clockwise and anticlockwise. They have written their Mai Ling story and explored chromatography in forest schools.
Next week we are looking forward to going to see the birds in Millets Falconry on Thursday. The trip will leave school at 10.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Science week has been fun! The children used microscopes on Wednesday, assisted by a research scientist Oxford University. On Thursday they learnt about animal behaviour from Luca’s Mum and loved hearing about positive rewards helping rescue animals learn to behave. In Maths they have made 3D shapes and in English they have learnt how to tell the Chinese story of Mai Ling. Please do ask them to tell you the story.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We had a great World Book Day filled week this week and the children all developed their own imaginary characters, which they illustrated and described for the school Book Day competition. They planted beans to grow hydroponically on the window and identified plants in Forest Schools. In Maths, they played with fractions by folding paper and remembered that they are equal parts of a whole.
Next week is Science Week and we are looking forward to using microscopes and exploring animal behaviour with visitors.</description>

Your children have written owl books, multiplied with arrays, painted with straws, laid footprint traps, explored habitats, learnt about Judaism and more this week. They’ve been busy!
On Thursday we visited the Library and the children were invited to take a book home. I have a list of the books they have borrowed. There is no pressure at all for the children to read the books, they may enjoy you reading to them or they may just want to dip in.</description>

It was lovely to see some of you at the concert on Monday and on Wednesday evening. Many thanks for your generosity to Snr Ruiz and I - I have some very lovely presents to put under the tree.

      <description>Dear Parents,
Your children have been a joy to teach this week. They have learned lots about how to make slime and how to choose which materials would be best for an umbrella or a bouncy ball. They have painted pine cones from the tree in forest schools and worked with clay in art. If you are cutting up pizzas ask them if fractions need to be equal. They know about halves, quarters and thirds … and quite a bit more.</description>

Your children have done amazingly again this week. You should be very proud of them. They have learned to use the bar model to find missing numbers in subtraction stories. They have made designs for 50 pound notes. They have researched scientists and made dens in the forest. And more. Please find attached a [song](/audio/Follow that star (performance track) copy.mp3) which they are learning for the concert. It would be wonderful if they could secretly practice at home.</description>

We will ask the children to make something using at least 3 different materials. Please help your children find something they can bring and maybe plan ahead in time what object they can make at school.</description>

I thought you might like to see some pictures from the building work today.

Re: Outdoor Learning in Year 2
Year 2 are being introduced to the principles of Forest School. We are lucky to have this facility on our site and a member of staff who has trained as a Forest school Leader.
Forest School uses the outdoor environment to support children’s learning across the whole curriculum. The activities specifically follow and enhance the learning from inside the classroom, with a very hands-on approach.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents and Guardians,
We are very much looking forward to welcoming your children in Class 2EE on Wednesday of this week. Sr Ruiz will be in the playground at 8.25 to greet them.
The first week will be making a class display which will include the word “hello” in all of the children’s home languages. It would be great if you could send a slip of paper with your child with the following information:</description>

      <description>Queridos padres de 1EE
We are only two weeks away from finishing this course, but we are still learning many things every day. I inform you that from today the children will send the finished work home being: red notebooks, the yellow notebook, math books and other work. So they are asked to take each day out of the blue backpack and stay home. In that way we avoid that the children do not arrive with a lot of weight at home.</description>

      <description>Queridos padres,
Tomorrow is our year1 joint end-of-year school trip to Cotswold Wildlife Park, Tuesday 19th of June.
Children will need to bring a small backpack on the day, where they can keep their lunch (picnic provided by the canteen regarding your child&#39;s lunch routine at school) and their bottle of water.
As the weather forecast looks to be good you may want to provide them with a hat, and put some sun cream on in the morning (before school).</description>

      <description>Queridos padres de 1EE,
We are already in the fourth week of this period. And I think we are getting a good rhythm of learning. As 1EE teacher, I am following the same learning system like Senorita Maria Castro but with some modifications that I consider beneficial with working with children.
Every week I send home homework, between math exercises, reading with Letrilandia or yellow study notebook. I will try to send only one thing each week, because I consider that with the DVDs and a little bit of homework it is enough for the children.</description>

      <description>Hi,
I took some notes at the phonics screening meeting this evening - I thought they might be useful to share with the whole class group via email.
The teachers are going to circulate the powerpoint slides from the meeting and some examples of the words they will have to read,
  Phonics Screening is a national &amp;lsquo;test&amp;rsquo; that takes place in Year 1 in the second week in June.</description>

      <description>Hola a todos,
This week I have sent in the yellow book words written with &amp;ldquo;y / ll&amp;rdquo;. Although they have the same sound your child should write them in the correct way. Read with them and you can ask them to write you different words on a paper. Another activity you can do is to read it to them and your child can find the picture or opposite (They read it to you and you can find the picture).</description>

They have to check how it is the weather every day and they should write the full sentence in Spanish.

      <description>Queridos padres,
Today in their blue bags you will see I haven&#39;t send the yellow book. We are starting little by little to recognise letters and sounds in Spanish, we are approaching smoothly to read in Spanish and because of that we have a book where has the letters that we are learning which they are taking home today.
As I told you, this is a world where the letters lives called &amp;quot;Letrilandia&amp;quot;, this week they can show you the real family &amp;quot;u, o, a, e, i&amp;quot; and you can read and look the drawings with them until pag.</description>

This week I have sent the song of the “Real Family” from “Letrilandia” in the yellow book, here you can watch the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViKdsqvDgc
  They may tell you already a story with this letters. It is a “Real Family” and they are different characters. If you go to that link, you can watch in the menu in the right hand side, different songs per letter. I am sure they would like to watch them, at the moment we have seen u, o, a, e, i and p.</description>
