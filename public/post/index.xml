      <description>Dear Parents,
We have had fun this week developing a play about the rainforest, making beautiful poetry using the word if and creating illustrations for a special card. We have played with in-between numbers, built towers as teams and each child has lit their own forest school fire with a flint and steel.
Please support your child in learning to spell these words with suffixes:

      <description>Dear Parents,
This is just to wish you a very happy half term with your children, who definitely deserve a rest. They have worked incredibly hard this month. We have had a lot of fun learning together.
This week they learnt about the water cycle and made three kinds of clouds. They wrote wonderful stories, created cubes with matchsticks, lay in the orchard and used their senses to make journey sticks.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Your children have worked super hard this week and deserve a weekend off - so no English homework this week other than reading their book to you. Hopefully this will give you time to enjoy reading a book for pleasure together.
We had a wonderful day today celebrating our international links. The children made complex flags showing all the different countries they felt connected with. They found the countries on a map and made a collaborative jigsaw of the whole world.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We have had fun this week making wind socks and weather vanes. Your child should be able to tell you how wind is made and how we can measure it and find its direction. In English we began to learn about the life of Beatrix Potter. In Maths we made posters explaining our understanding of operations and the children showed off their wonderful Maths as a Birthday treat for M.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
It has been great to see the children again this week. In Forest Schools they made elder necklaces and in English they wrote about a special place. They thought up questions about our new topic of the weather. They played coins, gave change for cakes and learnt how to answer word questions in Maths. In RE we started to explore Islam as our third religion this year.
For homework this week there are no extra spellings.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
The children have celebrated their wonderful hard work and creativity this term with a well-deserved jewel party today after bananas and chocolate cooked on the Forest School campfire. Thank you very much to all those parents who provided such wonderful party food for them.
As the Year 2 assessments come during the month of May, it would be great if you could gently support your child with some learning reminders in the holidays.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
I hope the children have already told you about the wonderful day we had yesterday at Millets Falconry. They held a northern white faced owl called “Quintessa” and learnt that owls have different coloured eyes depending on when they hunt. Please find photos attached (the app has duplicated some, apologies).
Today they planted sunflower seeds – one for Mum and one for themselves as a gift for Mother’s on Sunday’s UK Mother’s day.</description>

      <description>Dear parents,
This week we have been learning about plants we eat during our science lessons. The children have been learning that we may eat either a root (carrot, beetroot,&amp;hellip;), a stem (celery, asparagus,&amp;hellip;), leaves (lettuce, spinach, &amp;hellip;), flowers (artichoke, coliflower, brocoli, &amp;hellip;), seeds (peas, beans, &amp;hellip;), etc.
We are planning to do a healthy snack lesson on Monday trying to combine all of these products in a green salad. We would appreciate if you could pack for your child some of these products in small ziplock bags or tupper, ideally chopped in long sticks or ready to eat.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
This week the children have planted cress and set up a test to see if water and light affect its growth. They have explored fractions of amounts, painted symmetrical butterfly wings and turned shapes clockwise and anticlockwise. They have written their Mai Ling story and explored chromatography in forest schools.
Next week we are looking forward to going to see the birds in Millets Falconry on Thursday. The trip will leave school at 10.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Science week has been fun! The children used microscopes on Wednesday, assisted by a research scientist Oxford University. On Thursday they learnt about animal behaviour from Luca’s Mum and loved hearing about positive rewards helping rescue animals learn to behave. In Maths they have made 3D shapes and in English they have learnt how to tell the Chinese story of Mai Ling. Please do ask them to tell you the story.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We had a great World Book Day filled week this week and the children all developed their own imaginary characters, which they illustrated and described for the school Book Day competition. They planted beans to grow hydroponically on the window and identified plants in Forest Schools. In Maths, they played with fractions by folding paper and remembered that they are equal parts of a whole.
Next week is Science Week and we are looking forward to using microscopes and exploring animal behaviour with visitors.</description>

Your children have written owl books, multiplied with arrays, painted with straws, laid footprint traps, explored habitats, learnt about Judaism and more this week. They’ve been busy!
On Thursday we visited the Library and the children were invited to take a book home. I have a list of the books they have borrowed. There is no pressure at all for the children to read the books, they may enjoy you reading to them or they may just want to dip in.</description>

It was lovely to see some of you at the concert on Monday and on Wednesday evening. Many thanks for your generosity to Snr Ruiz and I - I have some very lovely presents to put under the tree.

Your children have been a joy to teach this week. They have learned lots about how to make slime and how to choose which materials would be best for an umbrella or a bouncy ball. They have painted pine cones from the tree in forest schools and worked with clay in art. If you are cutting up pizzas ask them if fractions need to be equal. They know about halves, quarters and thirds … and quite a bit more.</description>

I thought you might like to see some pictures from the building work today.

They learnt a lot about working in teams, keeping within a timeframe and learning from mistakes. I hope they mentioned it to you. They should be very proud of their hard work.

Re: Outdoor Learning in Year 2
Year 2 are being introduced to the principles of Forest School. We are lucky to have this facility on our site and a member of staff who has trained as a Forest school Leader.
Forest School uses the outdoor environment to support children’s learning across the whole curriculum. The activities specifically follow and enhance the learning from inside the classroom, with a very hands-on approach.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Today we have sent home a reading comprehension book to your child as part of this week&amp;rsquo;s homework. Please would you support your child in helping them read the first poem Big Red Boots on page 4 and answering the questions on page 5 as well as they can. This will be challenging for some children as it is a very formal lay out and asks them to answer specific questions.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We have had a great week with your bright children. I hope they tell you about some of the things they have learnt this week. Ask them about toasting marshmallows in Forest School, or writing instructions about how to make a sandwich &amp;hellip; and then making one. They can tell you about how c and g are scared of i,e and y. They may even be able to fill you in on how to find out the classes favourite sandwich - as a bar chart, or a tally.</description>

The children have been very busy at the biginning of this first term learning some words and vocabulary to provide a context for future learning (getting to know the school, classroom supplies, parts of the body, adjectives, food, etc.). Please, help them keep doing so by doing their homework and finding opportunities to ask them about what they have learnt at school.
This week we are sending the first book in a bag as reading homework.</description>

We are only two weeks away from finishing this course, but we are still learning many things every day. I inform you that from today the children will send the finished work home being: red notebooks, the yellow notebook, math books and other work. So they are asked to take each day out of the blue backpack and stay home. In that way we avoid that the children do not arrive with a lot of weight at home.</description>

      <description>Queridos padres,
Tomorrow is our year1 joint end-of-year school trip to Cotswold Wildlife Park, Tuesday 19th of June.
Children will need to bring a small backpack on the day, where they can keep their lunch (picnic provided by the canteen regarding your child&amp;rsquo;s lunch routine at school) and their bottle of water.
As the weather forecast looks to be good you may want to provide them with a hat, and put some sun cream on in the morning (before school).</description>

      <description>Queridos padres de 1EE,
We are already in the fourth week of this period. And I think we are getting a good rhythm of learning. As 1EE teacher, I am following the same learning system like Senorita Maria Castro but with some modifications that I consider beneficial with working with children.
Every week I send home homework, between math exercises, reading with Letrilandia or yellow study notebook. I will try to send only one thing each week, because I consider that with the DVDs and a little bit of homework it is enough for the children.</description>

This week I have sent in the yellow book words written with &amp;ldquo;y / ll&amp;rdquo;. Although they have the same sound your child should write them in the correct way. Read with them and you can ask them to write you different words on a paper. Another activity you can do is to read it to them and your child can find the picture or opposite (They read it to you and you can find the picture).</description>
