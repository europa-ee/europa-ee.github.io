As discussed at the meeting we are sending you the presentation that we shared with you and the list of sample words, which can be used for practise at home. The words include all the sounds that we have covered this year - the phase 3 and 5 sounds.

      <description>Hi,
I took some notes at the phonics screening meeting this evening - I thought they might be useful to share with the whole class group via email.
The teachers are going to circulate the powerpoint slides from the meeting and some examples of the words they will have to read,
 Phonics Screening is a national &amp;lsquo;test&amp;rsquo; that takes place in Year 1 in the second week in June.</description>

      <description>Hola a todos,
This week you can see in the yellow book two new pages:
 Song about &amp;ldquo;La se単orita Z&amp;rdquo; and picture of &amp;ldquo;La enfermera C&amp;rdquo;. This two letters have the same sound (like a snake), when Z goes with a, u, o and when C goes with e and i.
 Song about &amp;ldquo;La se単orita Z&amp;rdquo;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HZsQylt8xE

      <description>Hola a todos,
This week I have sent in the yellow book words written with &amp;ldquo;y / ll&amp;rdquo;. Although they have the same sound your child should write them in the correct way. Read with them and you can ask them to write you different words on a paper. Another activity you can do is to read it to them and your child can find the picture or opposite (They read it to you and you can find the picture).</description>

      <description>Hola a todos,
This week I am sending home the yellow book with a nice song about the seasons:

On the other hand I have sent homework in the yellow folder. They have to check how it is the weather every day and they should write the full sentence in Spanish. If they need it, they can look in the yellow book (last week entry), I am sure it will help them to do it.</description>
