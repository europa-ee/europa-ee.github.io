      <p>Dear parents and guardians,</p>

<p>It was great to have a chance to meet most of you on Wednesday. For those who couldn&rsquo;t attend this meeting, please, find attached the <a href="/docs/Parents meeting 2018.pdf">presentation</a> that we used that night.</p>

<p>Some reminders:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your children can start using <strong>Matific</strong> at home. Remember you only need to go to the website: <a href="https://www.matific.com">matific.com</a> and use your child&rsquo;s <strong>name+2ee</strong> as a username (for example: <strong>jose2ee</strong>), and the password is <strong>unodos</strong>. The activities will be uploaded progressively as we study each content from the Maths curriculum. Some activities are personalised according to their skills. Remember there are limited number of activities. These activities will be always in Spanish to reinforce the L2.</p></li>

<li><p>Please, bring your child with comfortable sport clothes on Tuesdays and Thursdays to do PE and outdoor learning. We will use the clothes from their PE kit only for emergencies or when there is a specific necesity.</p></li>

<li><p>Homework will be sent every Wednesday and will be collected on the following Wednesday to be checked. Remember not to spend more than 20 minutes a day doing homework. The children benefit more from real life situations that can be shown at home, the supermarket, the restaurant, etc., where they can think and learn (cooking, comparing, counting, measuring, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>We will have individual meetings with each one of you in November.  You will receive more information during the month of October.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any question or concern, please do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Jose A Ruiz-Martinez</p>
