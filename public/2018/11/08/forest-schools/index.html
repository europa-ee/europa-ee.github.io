      <p>Dear Parents</p>
<p><strong>Re: Outdoor Learning in Year 2</strong></p>
<p>Year 2 are being introduced to the principles of Forest School. We are lucky to have this facility on our site and a member of staff who has trained as a Forest school Leader.</p>
<p>Forest School uses the outdoor environment to support children’s learning across the whole curriculum. The activities specifically follow and enhance the learning from inside the classroom, with a very hands-on approach. This combination of freedom and responsibility is beneficial to all learners.</p>
<p>Year 2 will have these outdoor sessions once per week. They will experience all weathers and seasons and we hope that they will develop a deeper understanding about the natural world along the way. Outdoor learning sessions have been seen to improve personal confidence, motivation and concentration, social skills, language and communication skills and awareness and respect for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Practicalities</strong></p>
<p>Timetable:</p>
<ul>
<li>2DE Tuesday pm</li>
<li>2FE &amp; 2EE Friday pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Leader: Lydia Schroeder</p>
<p><strong>Kit List</strong></p>
<p>Winter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wellington boots or waterproof walking boots</li>
<li>Waterproof coat with hood</li>
<li>Waterproof over-trousers</li>
<li>Hat, gloves and scarf</li>
<li>Long trousers</li>
<li>Long socks</li>
<li>Long sleeved T-shirt</li>
<li>Warm jumper</li>
</ul>
<p>This kit will keep the children comfortable and safe, leaving them concentrate on learning and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Forest School Medical Form</strong></p>
<p>So that we have all the information in one place and also your additional permissions, please would you complete the form attached and return to school via the book bag.</p>
<p>We hope your children will bring home some of the enthusiasm which they are showing for the experience.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Liz Cook</p>
