      <p>Queridos padres,</p>
<p>Today in their blue bags you will see I haven't send the yellow book. We are starting little by little to recognise letters and sounds in Spanish, we are approaching smoothly to read in Spanish and because of that we have a book where has the letters that we are learning which they are taking home today.</p>
<p>As I told you, this is a world where the letters lives called <code>&quot;Letrilandia&quot;</code>, this week they can show you the real family <code>&quot;u, o, a, e, i&quot;</code> and you can read and look the drawings with them until pag. 23 (<code>p, l, m</code>). I know for some of you, it can be difficult to read it and for that I have recorded my voice for pags 19, 21 and 23. (attached wma in the email)</p>
<p>Please in this book, I do not expect them to write or to colour it in. This books are for continuous learning in the class and home and I expect you to look after it as best as you can. In case of losing it or very poor care of the book, I will reclaim money to buy more (£20), it isn't easy to bring books from Spain or to find them here.</p>
<p>If you want to buy it I have seen some in amazon or ebay, you only tape: &ldquo;letrilandia libro de lectura 1&rdquo; and you can have it, you don't need to do it because we have them in the class and sometimes they will take them home, like today.</p>
<p>The same as we do with the yellow book, I will need it back next Monday.</p>
<p>Muchas gracias,</p>
<p>Saludos.</p>
<p>Srta Maria</p>
