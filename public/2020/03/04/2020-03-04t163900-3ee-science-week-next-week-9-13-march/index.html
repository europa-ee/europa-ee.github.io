      <p>Dear 3EE parents,</p>
<p>It is science week next week. I am sorry this is a little last minute but if you feel you as a parent could come in next week and share a science  experiment or activity with the class please let Sofia and I know what it is and when you might be able to come in. Good times to share experiments are first thing in the morning 8.30-9.15am.</p>
<p>Also if your children have their own short experiment they would like to demonstrate (no more than 5 mins) it would be lovely to have science demonstrations from them on Monday or Tuesday afternoon from 2.50-3.20pm. If parents would like to support their child in presenting an experiment they are welcome to come in for the end of the day on Monday or Tuesday. Please email both class teachers to say what science activity or experiment your child would like to present. Ideally children would bring the equipment they need for their demonstration.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Ruthy Trevitt</p>
