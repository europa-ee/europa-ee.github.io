      <p>Dear 3EE parents,</p>
<p>Please find attached the plans and resources for the English part of the coming week with 3EE.</p>
<p>Expect your child to come home with maths workbooks which should be brought back into school Mon-Wed each week and remain at home the rest of the time. Although they are heavy A4 books it means if the school is suddenly closed or you have to self isolate then you have the main resources for our maths lessons.</p>
<p>Please be mindful that there is already a lot of extra work for teaching staff in preparing for two lots of lessons - lessons for those in school and adapted lessons for those working remotely. I have found it easier to send you the work for the whole week in one pdf email attachment. If you have any problems with the pdf please let me know. I apologise for the length and complexity of it but I do not feel I would be able to fit in sending separate day by day work emails for those working remotely.  It is a stressful time for all of us, parents, staff and children at the moment so patience and care for each other is essential and it is great to know how well you are already supporting each other as a parent body.</p>
<p>With kind regards and the very best wishes for good health to your children and your families,</p>
<p>Ruthy Trevitt</p>
