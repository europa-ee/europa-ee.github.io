      <p>Dear 3EE parents,</p>
<p>We have been very lucky to have Ernest Guevarra come in each Monday to teach the children basketball as one of their PE lessons. As the children will all too soon be starting swimming as a second PE lesson, we are nearing the end of these basketball sessions. Many of the children have really developed their skills and enjoy playing the sport. If they would like to continue with this interest there is a link here to basketball clubs in Oxfordshire which you could pursue with your child:

<p>Many thanks for your support, and an especial thank you to Ernest for giving up so much of his time and energy to give the children a really valuable set of PE lessons focused on basketball.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ruthy Trevitt</p>
