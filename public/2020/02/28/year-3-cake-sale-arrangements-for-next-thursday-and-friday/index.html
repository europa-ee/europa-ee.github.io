      <p>Dear year 3 parents,</p>
<p>Our cake sale is coming up on Thursday and Friday next week, we've put up posters and got our baking tins out in preparation. In order that the bus children in year 3 do not miss out on their own cake sale we would like to invite them to bring in £1 and choose a cake on Thursday 5th March, children not travelling on the bus may also do this if it is more convenient for you. Class teachers will collect the money and transfer it to the trips budget. Children can have the cake as a snack at morning or afternoon break (at the discretion of class teachers) or if they want to take one or more cakes home they can bring in a tub to carry them in (or reuse their snack box). If your child travels on the bus and you would like them to bring home more than one cake for their siblings or family please include the money accordingly (£1 a cake) and something to carry the cakes in. There is of course no obligation to buy any cake.</p>
<p>Thank you for the offers of help to sell the cakes. Please bring in donated cakes and any clean reuseable tubs that we can use for the sale on Wednesday 4th or Thursday 5th March to your child's class. Ensure any tupperware or tins you would like back are labelled with your child's name and class so they can be returned to you.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to visiting Narnia at Dorchester Abbey next week. Please remember to provide your child with a nut free packed lunch on the day of their trip: Tuesday for 3EE, Wednesday for 3DE, Thursday for 3FE.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Year 3 team</p>
