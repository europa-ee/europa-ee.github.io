## Maths

If you like to have video lessons to go with your maths lessons choose one of these three places to do your maths lessons whilst you are learning at home. You can use these instead of your green power maths workbooks if you prefer. It is probably best not to mix the places you get your maths lessons from, so either do the power maths lessons I have set out or use one of these sites below.

### Week 5 White Rose Maths 

If you want to use the White Rose Maths plan and their teaching videos then you will find the videos, worksheets, and answers linked below.

### Read

This week we are really lucky to have some poems and related activities presented to us by **Kate Wakeling**, the poet herself!

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vimeo-Hello from Kate Wakeling-1AB7EA?style=for-the-badge&logo=Vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/418408494)

The three poems are:

1. Shadow Boy [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Shadow Boy-EC1C24?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe Acrobat Reader)](/docs/Shadow Boy_2.pdf) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vimeo-Shadow Boy-1AB7EA?style=for-the-badge&logo=Vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/418408941)

2. My Ghost Sister [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-My Ghost Sister-EC1C24?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe Acrobat Reader)](/docs/My Ghost Sister_2.pdf) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vimeo-My Ghost Sister-1AB7EA?style=for-the-badge&logo=Vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/418411869)

3. Instruments of Use [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Instruments of Use-EC1C24?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe Acrobat Reader)](/docs/Instruments of Use_2.pdf) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vimeo-Instruments of Use-1AB7EA?style=for-the-badge&logo=Vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/418408653)

You have all three English sessions, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to carry out these activities. 

Maybe start off by listening to and reading all of the three poems (there is a link on each sheet to a video of Kate reading that poem). Then choose your favourite one and answer the questions about it. Then on another day you could try taking a photo (use the tips and ideas on the sheet to help you) and use the photo to help inspire you to write your own poem. There are ideas on the sheet for how to write your own similar style poem. 

It may be that you only have time to do one poem sheet really well over the three days. Or you may get super excited by it and do a different poem activity sheet on each day. Whether you work through one activity sheet or all three I hope you really enjoy being creative with poetry writing and photography. 
I can't wait to see the photos and poems you produce!
