**Time:** 10.30 - 11.00

**Activity:** BREAK

<hr>

**Time:** 11:00 - 11.30 

**Activity:** English: Spelling

Spend only 30 minutes on spellings. Do the spelling test - get someone else (could be a sibling or grandma on the phone) to read out the list and maybe put them in a sentence to help you. 

**Common Exception Words (A)** | &nbsp; &nbsp; | **Spelling test rule (time words)**
:---: | :---: | :---:
1. actually | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 11. often
2. all | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 12. recent
3. although | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 13. regular
4. again | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 14. forwards
5. favourite | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 15. perhaps
6. are | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 16. probably
7. our | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 17. certain
8. your | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 18. favourite
9. my | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 19. popular
10. after | &nbsp; &nbsp; | 20. length

If you still have time then try the spelling activity sheet and presentation attached below. I like the "picturing words" one as it is quite fun but I got stuck for a bit on the one with a picture of a boat. My tip is to ignore the boat and think of the proper name for the paddles you use in a rowing boat. Extension - can you make your own "picturing words" puzzles by drawing some parts of a long word (where there are words within the longer word), I'd love to try some of your puzzles! It's the holidays next week so no spellings to learn.

**Time:** 11.30 - 12.00

**Activity:** English: creative writing

Firstly - you only need to spend 30 minutes doing this so if you haven't finished all the tasks, that's ok, stop!

Secondly - if you find you are loving limericks then you could carry it on as an afternoon project.

The "[Laughable limericks](/docs/3EE Laughable limericks.pdf)" document is attached twice. Once as a Google Doc if you want to type into it and as a [PDF](/docs/3EE Laughable limericks.pdf) if you want to electronically fill it in or print it.
