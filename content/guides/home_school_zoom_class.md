[Zoom](https://zoom.us) has become an important tool for distance learning specifically in facilitating virtual classes. For Class 3EE, we plan to initiate some parent-led classes via [Zoom](https://zoom.us). This guide describes our plans on how to manage and facilitate these virtual classes in [Zoom](https://zoom.us).

## 1. Use two hosts in the [Zoom](https://zoom.us) classroom

To faciliate the virtual class, we will be using a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) account that allows for two hosts. One host will be the main speaker/presenter/teacher whilst the other host will be in the background dealing with the technology and the interaction. We thought this will be the best way to maximise a 1 hour class/session with a class size of up to 28 kids and still be as interactive as possible and with all kids having eaual chances of participating.

## 2. Set default settings of [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to reinforce classroom "rules"

One of the biggest challenges of holding a virtual class particularly for children in the younger age groups is being able to reinforce classroom "rules" that ensures discipline whilst at the same time encourages participation.
