8.25 - 8.40 | Registration: change books, set up and change shoes for PE
8.40 - 9.00 | PE: we will be following the exercise video available here for free (it is on a subscription site but some trial sessions are free to view) - https://watch.lesmillsondemand.com/born-to-move-free/season:1/videos/born-to-move-17-6-7-baila-with-me
9.00 - 9.45 | Spellings: do test for last week's spellings then practise next week's; If you are doing this at home please send me your child's score out of 10 for 1-10 and your child's score out of 10 for 11-20 so we can continue to keep track of their progress in spelling (especially with the CE, Common Exception words).
