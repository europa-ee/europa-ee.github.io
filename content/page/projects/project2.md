Research one of the animals that lives at Beale Park, they are listed on the pdf which explains what you need to do. Record your research on the google classroom document. You will be asked to research it in Spanish as well as English - look out for the Spanish project in a few weeks. 

The recording sheet is for you to write your research notes. They can be bullet points, they do not need to be full sentences, they are just notes to help you remember the information. You can use any animal non fiction books you have. Also good websites to use are [Beale Park](https://www.bealepark.org.uk/animals/) and [National Geographic Kids](https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/) and you may find others, share them with your friends.
