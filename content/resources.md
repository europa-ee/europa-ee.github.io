# [Videos](/videos)

This is a collection of videos (available via YouTube) referred to by teachers in the kids' Spanish red (REE) and yellow (1EE) workbook. For REE, a link to the YouTube video playlist is available. Single embedded videos will be added soon. For 1EE, single embedded videos are provided and a link to the YouTube video playlist is available.

You can choose to either subscribe to the linked playlist via your own YouTube account so that the video playlist can be available to you when you go into your own YouTube account. The alternative is to make your own copy of the playlist into your own YouTube account and name the playlist as you would like to. If you do not have a YouTube account/Google account, just choose to go to this website and click on the links provided.
