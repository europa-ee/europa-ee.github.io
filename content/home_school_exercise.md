## Europa School UK How to Guide

A [website](https://sites.google.com/europaschool.uk/europahowtoforstudents) created and provided by Europa School UK that provides some instructions about the [Google for Education](https://edu.google.com) suite used by the school. This guide is aimed at students and includes a [Code of Conduct](https://sites.google.com/europaschool.uk/europahowtoforstudents/code-of-conduct) for use of the [Google for Education](https://edu.google.com) suite that students need to be aware of.

For younger (primary) students, this is something that parents are expected to read and discuss with their children as the [Google for Education](https://edu.google.com) suite will require some support and assistance from parents for younger primary students to be able to fully use for their distance learning.
