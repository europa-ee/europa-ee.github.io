You could put together some of your favourite poems into a book (a collection of poems is called an anthology), you might like to write some of your own - you could search for poem types such as limericks, haiku or for favourite poets - some of mine are Michael Rosen and Janet Ahlberg. You could make a beautiful book out of them with pictures and lovely cursive handwriting. You could type them and make an electronic book to send me or make a presentation (you each have a presentation if you want to edit it).
