Don't include 'the fate of Judas' as it portrays Judas as he hanged himself in remorse, not suitable for this age group - just explain that he regretted betraying Jesus.

Follow up work on this tomorrow.

RE not covered every week hence a longer focus on it this week.

Create more of your own fractions problems using shape and number and keep using PART, EQUAL PARTS and WHOLE, ask a friend/parent to solve them. 

* Shape problem e.g. if one part of the shape is a square and there are 5 equal parts what could the whole shape be? A long oblong (meaning longer in one dimension than another) rectangle, a cross shape, an L shape or other. 

* Number problem e.g. if one part of a plate of cupcakes is 3 cup cakes and there are 4 equal parts how many cakes are there on the whole plate?
