Dear year 3 parents,

In case of school closure please find attached a research project which we usually carry out over the Easter holidays in the lead up to our trip to Beale Park. Whilst the trip may not now happen, as nothing can be assured at this time, it would be good for the children to have a chance to carry out this research.

This research will be used after the scheduled Easter holidays to put together a presentation in both the stream language and English.

Many thanks,

Year 3 team
