Dear Parents,

Your children's work was shown in assembly today and I thought you might like to see it.  Class 2EE made beautiful film riddles using their senses and lots of adjectives - they described two places in the school and challenged the other children to guess where they had been.

To see the films just click on the link below or cut and paste it into your internet browser.
