Dear Parents,

Thanks so much to those of you who provided food and drink for the children's jewel party today.  We had music, dancing, film and bubbles.  I've attached some photos for you to enjoy.

In the children's book bags are clay stars and Christmas poems they have made as presents, as well as Christmas cards they have made too.  Please do hunt them out.

I have sent home Reading Comprehension books/ Phonics books depending on your child's level.  I've also included a Christmas grammar collection which is optional, just in case you are stuck in traffic and want something to let the children get their teeth into if they are bored.  Please do not feel you have to do any of this with your children if they just need a break from it all.  Do please keep reading though, as they are making such wonderful progress.

I hope you enjoy their poems and their company over Christmas. Thanks for all your support for the children and for Snr Ruiz and myself over the last term.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
