Dear Parents,

It has been great to see the children again this week. In Forest Schools they made elder necklaces and in English they wrote about a special place. They thought up questions about our new topic of the weather.  They played coins, gave change for cakes and learnt how to answer word questions in Maths. In RE we started to explore Islam as our third religion this year.

For homework this week there are no extra spellings. Instead, please support your child in working through questions 7 – 14 in the attached Maths Reasoning paper.  These can be discussed orally together or drawn on paper.  The children do not need to bring their work into class, just bring their experience of having tried to work them out with you in their head next week.  We will go through the questions together next week.  (Questions 1 – 5 on these papers are read out by the teacher, so don’t worry that they look unclear – they do not make sense without the teacher script).  

Next week we will be running with the wind.  Please could you send in an empty plastic 1l bottle with your child’s name on it if you have one?  This will help us find out which direction the wind is blowing in.

Wishing you a very happy weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
