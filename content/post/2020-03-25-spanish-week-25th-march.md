Dear 3EE parents

This week we will be looking at the following:

* Maths: measure and revising the 2 and 4 timetables

* Spanish: say and ask for directions, verb ser and vivir

* DoW: the city (orientation, places in the city)

* Reading: reading comprehension "cuando trabajé en el circo"

* Art: craft "the city"

I also recommend to do some physical activities at least 1 hour a day.

Have a good week.

Sofia
