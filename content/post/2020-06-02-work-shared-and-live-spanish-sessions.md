Dear parents
 
Please see below the link to access the Google Drive where you can see some of the children's work. We picked some of the amazing work children have sent in but there is much more, so if you would like to add some of your work that is not on there, please feel free to add it.

Also, from this week Eva or I will be doing some live sessions with children to check how they are doing, practise Spanish and revise contents. We will be doing a quiz about the contents we have learnt and Spanish interactions. We will start this Friday at around 11.30 so please let me know if your child is able to join us. Depending on how many children there are, I will have to do a few groups to be able to listen and talk to everyone, so an invitation with the exact day and time will be sent to you. I'm planning to do it once a week.
 
Please, see below the link to give consent for your child to participate on live video conferencing, without this consent they won't be allowed to participate.

Thanks
