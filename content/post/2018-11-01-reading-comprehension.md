Dear Parents,

Today we have sent home a reading comprehension book to your child as part of this week's homework.   Please would you support your child in helping them read the first poem Big Red Boots on page 4 and answering the questions on page 5 as well as they can.  This will be challenging for some children as it is a very formal lay out and asks them to answer specific questions.  We are using this book because it mimics the reading comprehensions which they will meet later in the year, helping them navigate the format.  

Lots of support from you and an enjoyable shared experience would help launch this new homework for your child.  We will mark it using a marking scheme and return it each week so that your child can see their progress.

If other parents ask why their child has not yet received the same homework - it is because we have not sent these books to those children in the class who are still building their fluency in reading.  We want them to focus on that fluency and comprehension first.  Most children will receive reading comprehensions at some point in the year.  

Many thanks.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
