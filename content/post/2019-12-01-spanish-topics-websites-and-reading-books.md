Dear parents

Some parents wanted to know the topics we will be learning this year in Spanish. You can see this below, so you can also support them with this at home:

* Family
* Descriptions
* Pats of the body
* Jobs
* Christmas in Spain
* Clothes
* The weather
* Nationalities, where people are from
* Carnival
* Our town
* Shops
* Plants, life cycle of plants
* Animals, habitats, life cycles
* Semana Santa, Easter in Spain
* Food, in the restaurant. Hygiene processing food
* Five senses

Also, I recommend these websites which are good for children to revise vocabulary and contents we learn in class.

[www.onlinefreespanish.com](https://www.onlinefreespanish.com)(with vocabulary about different topics, games, songs and lots of activities that can be printed as well).

[www.mundoprimaria.com](https://www.mundoprimaria.com) (interactive online activities and games for spanish and maths).

As some parents wanted to know how reading books work, I will clarify this a bit more. Every half term we focus on one book to read with the whole class (List of these books was sent in September). We are reading at the moment in class "Cuando me convertí en lobo" we read around 6 pages in class and they have to read the same pages at home (it is written in their little orange book, which is their reading record) Please leave a comment about how was your child reading or just if it was read or not, this will help us to know how they are getting on.

A few children are taking a different book home and this is written in their orange book too and the number of pages they need to read at home. Then they will have to do some comprehension activities in class from these pages.

Alternatively, we encourage children to take books from our class library as their choice and they can read as much as they want from these books. They can take the book they like home with them to continue reading it and bring back when they finish. They just need to write down the name of the book that they take in our library record book. 

In class, we normally spend some time reading books from the library and doing some writing from them too. So they get opportunities to read different stories and types of books.

I hope you find this useful.

Thanks for your help and support.

Sofia
