Dear Parents,

Thank you! The Fun Run this morning was wonderful thanks to your support for your children.   

This week the children learnt how to whittle willow in Forest Schools. They made infinity tiles and finished their wonderful fiction books which they will be reading to 1EE next week. They  made their own model of "values which they would choose to hold up their life like pillars" â€“ inspired by the five pillars of Islam.

In your child's bag you will find details of a school Maths competition and piece of A4 squared paper. This is homework instead of spellings.  Please help your child make a design colouring the squares on the paper to show one of the values of our school. The winning design will be made as a wall mural with real coloured tiles in the autumn term and will stand, we hope, for many years to come on the walls of the school.

Have a wonderful weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
