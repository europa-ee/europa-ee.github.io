Dear Parents,

The children had a fascinating time today playing with real money hot off the press from De La Rue.

They have brought home a pencil made of old bank notes to show you. Tomorrow we will be enjoying testing out building with materials to see if they are waterproof in Forest Schools. Please do make sure that your child has suitable clothing. It will be cold and possibly wet Gloves, hats, warm coats and waterproof trousers are ideal.  

This weekâ€™s spelling pattern is words containing the `ow` vowel digraph. 

1. brown 

2. down 

3. own 

4. grow 

5. show 

6. old 

7. gold 

8. hold 

9. told 

10. cold 

Many thanks for supporting your children in learning these and reading regularly.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
