Dear parents,

The author Matt Brown will be visiting some of our junior classes on Tuesday 19th November. This is a rescheduled visit so if your child purchased a Matt Brown book a few weeks ago and would like it signed please do bring it in and he can sign it on the day. If your child would like to purchase any further titles at a discounted price please use the online payment method detailed in the attached letter or bring the correct cash or cheque and a completed form (attached) to buy the book on the day. We can have a few copies of the form printed out on the day if you do not have access to a printer - in that case please send a note with the cash/cheque your child brings in.

We hope all your children will enjoy finding out what life as an author is like and putting their questions to Matt Brown.
