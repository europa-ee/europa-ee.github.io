Good evening,

Some of you have been asking when the children should bring their homework back.

Homework shouldn't be done in one go. As the children share 2 teachers, it makes sense to try to bring the one I set on a Monday so they also have time to do Mrs Cook's homework. So, I will expect it back every Monday.

This week, they just have to complete the sheet they took today and Maths games. The rest is for those children who have been ill.

I hope this makes sense.

Kind regards,

Mrs Lane
