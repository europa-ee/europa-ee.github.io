Dear Parents, 

This week the children have planted cress and set up a test to see if water and light affect its growth.  They have explored fractions of amounts, painted symmetrical butterfly wings and turned shapes clockwise and anticlockwise. They have written their Mai Ling story and explored chromatography in forest schools.  

Next week we are looking forward to going to see the birds in Millets Falconry on Thursday.   The trip will leave school at 10.15 and arrive back at school at 14.00, so there will be no difference in normal drop off and pick up times.  

Please note the following:

* Your child must wear warm, waterproof clothing on Thursday. Any child without a long sleeved waterproof coat and a jumper will not be allowed to join us on the trip.  

* Strong footwear for muddy farm.

* Children must bring a small backpack to carry lunch.

* Children on school lunches will have a packed lunch from school provided.  Children who usually bring their own lunch on a Thursday will need to provide their lunch as usual.

* Please send a labeled, non-leaking water bottle too.

* No toys or cards.

* If your child suffers from sickness on coaches, please let us know so that we can seat them near the front.
	
Thanks to you all for ensuring the trip is a good one.
