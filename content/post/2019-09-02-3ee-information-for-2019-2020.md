Dear 3EE parents,

We look forward to getting to know you better and will be delighted to see you at the information evening to be held in the next few weeks. In advance of this meeting please find nearly all the information you will need about this year. For the small things we may have forgotten please let us know in advance of the information evening so we can provide you with answers at the meeting.

Two requests for parent help in the English (first) half of the week: for reading and sports. If there are any parents who would like to read with children (including of course their own child) on a **Tuesday or Wednesday morning from 8.25-8.45** please do email Mrs Trevitt. Lastly if there are any parents who are keen on sports and would like to help develop the children's ball game skills we will be having a **short PE lesson on a Monday for the autumn and spring terms from 15.00-15.30 (you could pick up your child immediately after)**. The main PE lesson will be on a Wednesday afternoon (see attached information sheet for more details). It would be great to have some help from dads, mums or other keen family members, even if you can only commit for a block of 3 weeks. The aim is to develop the children's ball and game skills through a short focused skill practice and then game - this could be football, basketball or any other suitable ball game. We have an outside tennis court space booked with the alternative indoor space being the Schumann Hall.

With best wishes and many thanks,

Mrs Ruthy Trevitt and Mrs Sofia Morton
