Hello 3EE,

Thank you for working so hard at home. I am sorry we can't work face to face with everyone at the moment. The start of next term will see us continuing with school at home. 

I love seeing your work and hearing from you, when you hand things in please can you include a little comment in the comments section. Just say how you found it (just writing 'done' isn't very helpful) then I know I need to have a little look at it. With maths you don't need to hand anything in as you have the answers so you can mark it yourselves. In English it is really helpful for me to know you have handed something in so I can look at it and give you some feedback on what you have done well and what could be improved. 

You can always email me if you want to share some pictures or ask for help and I will try and reply as soon as I can. I am looking after the Tiny Trevitts and trying to teach them too so I can't usually answer straight away but I should be able to reply within a day or two to give you feedback.

Have a wonderful holiday and get inventive with your imagination - I would love to see what you get up to this holiday.

See you back on google classroom on Monday 20th April. Next half term I will publish all the assignments at the start of the week so you can plan your week in a different way if you prefer. They will still have the day of the week on them though so you can choose to do them on those days.

Happy Easter,

Mrs Trevitt
