Dear parents
 
Our last online Spanish session will be next Tuesday 30th June at 12:00. I will send the invitation to Google meet to the children's email.
 
I will invite all the class to be together in the same meeting so we can say goodbye to everyone before the summer break.
 
I will prepare a quiz and we will end the session remembering one of the songs we learnt earlier this year, "weather". I've attached the song lyrics and see below the link to the song so they can practise at home before our session on Tuesday and we can all sing it together.

I've also prepared some certificates for them to give after the session for all the hard work they have been doing at home during this situation and for being so good staying at home. They will be sent to their email addresses.
 
I hope they can all make it.
 
Looking forward to seeing them on Tuesday.
 
Sofia
