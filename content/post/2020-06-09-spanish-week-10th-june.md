Dear parents
 
In Spanish, this week we will be learning the following:
 
* **Spanish:** opposites, food vocabulary, likes and dislikes and dialogue in a cafe.
 
* **Reading:** we will read the story "the little red hen" and some comprehension activities. Also, we will continue reading "Para hacer un pastel de manzana". If you don't have the book, let me know what book they are reading instead and record an audio reading some of the book so I can evaluate their reading progress.
 
* **DoW:** Vocabulary related to food. In a cafe.
 
* **Maths:** Fractions. I've also added a challenge in the assignment "Para ampliar" (To extend) if they want to do more challenging activities.
 
* **Art:** I've set a project where they have to build their own toy or game using recycled materials. I've attached the link to a website where they can see some examples.
 
Have a nice week.
