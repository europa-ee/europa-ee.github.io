Dear Parents,

Class 2EE had a great week this week, I hope they have already told you about the helicopter seeds they made to understand seed dispersal, plant art with cardboard pieces, measuring g, kg, ml and litres and writing about their magic gardens.  We welcomed a new child to our class, Ariadne joined us just in time to celebrate her birthday.

Spellings this week are the “or” sound spelt as “a”.  Please do practice them for the spelling test on Wednesday of next week.

1.	all

2.	ball

3.	call

4.	called

5.	calling

6.	walk

7.	walking

8.	talk

9.	talking

10.	always

Belinda kindly sent a Whats App message to you, letting those parents who were not at the SATs evening know about the three SATs papers which your child has completed prior to the half term.  The children were told that these were just my normal assessments to help me know what they still would like me to teach them.  They were not presented formally or told that they are “tests”.  So I would be grateful if you do not discuss the papers with your child at all.  

For some children, they will have far more knowledge than they are currently able to show in this written format.  Many will be able to show maths concepts physically and explain them, without yet being able to independently represent them in written form.  So please do not feel that they are “failing” in any way if their scores are still low.  If you have concerns, please do contact me and we can discuss together how best to support your child at school and home.  

Every single child in the class at the current time is working really well and giving their very best.

Have a wonderful weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
