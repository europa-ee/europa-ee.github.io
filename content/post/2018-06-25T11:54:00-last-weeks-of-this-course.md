Queridos padres de 1EE

We are only two weeks away from finishing this course, but we are still learning many things every day. I inform you that from today the children  will send the finished work home being: red notebooks, the yellow notebook, math books and other work. So they are asked to take each day out of the blue backpack and stay home. In that way we avoid that the children  do not arrive with a lot of weight at home.

On the other hand, it is reported that we have stopped sending DVDs home, so this week and next week we ask for your return.

Without more for the moment, we look forward to seeing you on Wednesday, July 4 at 2.45pm in the 1EE class.

Un cordial saludo

Francisca Moreno
