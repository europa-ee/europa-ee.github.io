Dear parents
 
I hope you had a nice week with your children.
 
In Spanish, this final half term we will be learning the following:
 
* **Spanish:** Synonym and antonym, vocabulary about food, dialogue in a restaurant and vocabulary related to it, diminutive and augmentative suffixes and talking about plans using the future tense.
 
* **Reading:** This half term we will be reading the book "para hacer un pastel de manzana" that we asked to have at the beginning of the year. You can find it here: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link-Para hacer un pastel de manzana-4285F4?logo=Google Chrome&style=for-the-badge)](https://www.bookdepository.com/Para-hacer-un-pastel-de-manzana-Make-Apple-Pie-Pablo-Albo/9788426372673?ref=grid-view&qid=1591033318203&sr=1-1)
 
Also we will be reading some other stories: Clara's farm, the little red hen and the Bremen town musicians.
 
* **Ortography:** Sound x and k in their Rubio workbook, which we will finish this term.
 
* **DoW:** Where food comes from, farm animals, five senses, food and ordering in a cafe, daily routines, the summer.
 
* **Maths:** Divisions, fractions, measurement of capacity (kilo and litre).
 
* **Art:** craft "make your farm", create a toy using recycling materials, father's day craft and different art creations.
 
Thanks for your help.
 
Have a lovely week.
 
Sofia
