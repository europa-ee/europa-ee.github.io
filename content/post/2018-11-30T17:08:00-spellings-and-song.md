Dear Parents.

Your children have done amazingly again this week. You should be very proud of them. They have learned to use the bar model to find missing numbers in subtraction stories. They have made designs for 50 pound notes. They have researched scientists and made dens in the forest. And more. Please find attached a [song](/audio/Follow that star (performance track) copy.mp3) which they are learning for the concert. It would be wonderful if they could secretly practice at home.

I think that Snr Ruiz has already asked you to be ready for them to wear a white top, dark trousers and a Santa hat for the concert on the 10th December. If you have a problem with this, just let me know.

The children also asked me to send home a copy of the game they have been playing in school today. Please find it attached.

This weekâ€™s words to learn: 

1.	car

2.	start

3.	park

4.	arm

5.	garden

6.	her

7.	term

8.	verb

9.	person

10.	herb

This week the pattern is words containing the vowel phonemes `ar/er`.

Happy weekend!

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
