Dear Parents and Guardians,

We are very much looking forward to welcoming your children in Class 2EE on Wednesday of this week. Sr Ruiz will be in the playground at 8.25 to greet them.

The first week will be making a class display which will include the word **“hello”** in all of the children’s home languages.  It would be great if you could send a slip of paper with your child with the following information: 

**Name of child and preferred nickname.**

**“Hello” written in all your home spoken languages -  telling us which language it is.**

If you have any concerns at all or any questions, do feel free to contact us directly. 

Looking forward to Wednesday morning, 

Liz Cook and Jose Ruiz
