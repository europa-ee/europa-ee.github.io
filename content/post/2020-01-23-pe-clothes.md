Dear parents

This email has been sent to me from the PE teacher to pass on to all of you.

Dear parents,

Since the beginning of the school year I agreed that children could wear comfortable clothes on their PE day to avoid getting changed for PE. Nevertheless, they end up getting their trousers, socks and shoes quite wet and muddy during breaks, and consequently they end up bringing the dirt into the gym. It is recommended to provide them with a spare pair of socks, leggings/tracksuit trousers/shorts and leave it in the PE back at school so they can get changed if needed. Also, many of the children still keep forgetting to bring proper indoor shoes, with clean soles, please check that they are all clean and are only used indoors.

Thank you very much for your cooperation,

With kind regards

Alba Gorris
