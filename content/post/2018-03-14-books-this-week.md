Hola a todos,

This week we have seen two new characters in Letrilandia which sounds the same in Spanish (b and v) the children are taking Letrilandia home to read them with you. (audio attached, pag 45 and 47).

In the yellow book you will see different words written with b and v, please try to write with them as last week you did with y and ll. You can read them again (y and ll) and continue reading until pag 51.

On another hand, just to let you know Miss Drymlova had her little baby on the 8th of March, both are ok. Next week the new spanish teacher (Srta. Francisca) will be with us at some point to see what we are doing during Spanish days and for them to know her. As you know she will start after Easter break with them.

Have a nice week,

Srta. Maria
