Dear Parents,

Your children have been a joy to teach this week.  They have learned lots about how to make slime and how to choose which materials would be best for an umbrella or a bouncy ball. They have painted pine cones from the tree in forest schools and worked with clay in art. If you are cutting up pizzas ask them if fractions need to be equal. They know about halves, quarters and thirds … and quite a bit more. They have written a wonderful class poem about Christmas and they are all set to perform beautifully on Monday – bring your tissues.

This week’s spelling words to learn have `ir/ur`.  I’ve added in a few tricky words they are finding hard in their written work.

1. girl

2. Church

3. shirt

4. first

5. third

6. turn

7. hurt

8. because

9. who

10. why

It was great to meet some of you last Wednesday evening.  We’ll look forward to seeing more next Wednesday.

All the best,

Liz Cook
