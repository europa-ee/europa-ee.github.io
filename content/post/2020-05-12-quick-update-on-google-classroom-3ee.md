Dear parents,

I will be deleting old assignments and generally reducing what is on google classroom as I know it is getting busy. Please let me know which of the afternoon projects you would like retained. Also if there is anything else you would like to keep. Otherwise I will delete all but the last week of English work. I will keep the stories recorded by Louise and I. Looking forward to hearing from you this week if you haven't already emailed or your child hasn't handed some work in.

Best wishes,

Ruthy Trevitt
