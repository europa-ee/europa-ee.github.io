Dear parents and guardians,

The children have been very busy at the biginning of this first term learning some words and vocabulary to provide a context for future learning (getting to know the school, classroom supplies, parts of the body, adjectives, food, etc.). Please, help them keep doing so by doing their homework and finding opportunities to ask them about what they have learnt at school.

This week we are sending the first book in a bag as reading homework. You will find a yellow reading log to write some comments about the reading on it. This bag should be back to school every Wednesday together with their homework, in order to change the book for a new one.

Finally, I would like to remind you that your children can log into Matific using their *username:* **name2ee** and *password:* **unodos** (all lower case).

I hope you have a lovely half term.

Kind regards,

Jose A Ruiz-Martinez
