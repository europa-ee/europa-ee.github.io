Good afternoon,

I have just added  the homework for this week to be brought back next week.

They have a capital letter and stops worksheet which they took with them today but it is also in the google classroom page for those who could not attend school.

In Maths, all of them have just games. We have been revisiting 3 digit numbers and the 2x and 5x . They will have a 2x and 5x test next Monday.

In writing, they have used the planning sheet which they filled in using the information from their Spanish leaflets. For those ones who have not been at school, all this is google classroom.

Next week, they will also be tested in capital letters and stops. 

In Discover of the world (DOW), we have been learning about living beings, types of human beings and we discussed why humans beings are different to other animals. If they want, they can create a poster explaining all this in Spanish but this is not compulsory.

The children are not taking books home yet because we are in a temporary room and I need to gather all the books that have been ordered (which are in the other building) and arrange them. Sorry for this.

I hope all of this make sense.
