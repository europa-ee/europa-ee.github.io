Dear 3EE parents,

I am so sorry to have to email another change, something has been organised by school for Wednesday morning which clashes with our planned meeting. So we will be meeting on **Tuesday 30th June from 2-2.30pm**, this is the only suitable time I have a break from teaching that day but I am really looking forward to seeing as many of 3EE as possible.

Children will have a chance to share one favourite memory of 3EE so it would be helpful if you can remind them to listen well to others (mute microphones when it's not their turn) as we are very time limited and it would be nice to hear from everyone who wants to share.

Best wishes,

Ruthy Trevitt
