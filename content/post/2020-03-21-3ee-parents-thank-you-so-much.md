Dear 3EE parents,

Just to say we have really appreciated your kind words and messages over the last week, thank you. On Monday we have a chance as staff to work out how we deliver Virtual Europa, thanks for your patience as we get used to this new normal.

In an attempt to deliver a bedtime story, a video of a picture book should have appeared on your child’s google classroom account. Sorry it didn’t make it in time for this evening - turns out uploading videos on iPads takes a while. Please let us know if it works or not.

Hope you have a lovely Mother’s Day, make the most of video calls to family and we hope to virtually speak to you and the class soon.

Very best wishes,

Ruthy and Sofia
