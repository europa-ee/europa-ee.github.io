Dear parents,

The email below was sent to your children's accounts.

I have heard from most children this week either via questions from parents or from work they have handed in (whether that was maths or English). If you or your child hasn't got in touch in this way this week please could you or your child send a short message to let me know how they are getting on. One word 'ok' is absolutely fine, I know we are all time pressured.

**EMAIL SENT TO CHILDREN BELOW**

Hi 3EE,

I have enjoyed checking out the work you handed in so far this week. I can only check and comment on work that gets handed in or emailed to me though. I am happy to answer questions when I can. It is fine if you prefer not to hand in things on google classroom but if you want to do that please could you send me a short email to let me know how you are getting on this week.
 
Many thanks,

Mrs Trevitt
