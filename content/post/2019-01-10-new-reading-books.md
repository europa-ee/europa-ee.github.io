Dear parents, 

Thank you so much for all of your effort and contributions to buy new books for our classroom.

Yesterday we sent lots of new books in your kids' reading bag to read at home. Please, write some commnets on their reading log about their reading as they read the book, and don't worry if they don't finish to read the whole book in a week, they can be hold at home to read at your/your child's convenience. There is no rush to return the book. They will need to return it once they have finished to read it and are ready to receive a new one. 

Some tips to read with your kids are:

* Talk about the title, making predictions (what is this book going to be about?, making connections to other books they know, etc.)

* Read and jot down some of the tricky words that they have difficulty to read (maybe too long words or unknown) and try to work on those words reading them several times, looking for meaning, etc.

* Read several times until your kids read the words from the text with more fluency.

* Check for comprehension. Stop and ask questions: where is the story happening? what is happening in the story? What is the main character going to do? What is the problem? What is the solution? What is the moral of the story? Connections to other stories they have read, etc.

* Draw a picture of your best part of the story.

* Write in few words what happens in the story (summary).

* Write a description of the setting/character/etc.

* Write a different ending.

* etc.

I hope you enjoy reading these books with your children and make use of this opportunity to practice the Spanish language and build and consolidate more vocabulary.

Thanks for all of your help.

Kind regards,

Jose Ruiz
