Dear parents

This week in Spanish we will be learning the following:

* **Maths:** Time tables 7 and 8 and activities for revision in their Rubio maths workbook.

* **Spanish:** collective nouns and revision of verb tenses (past, present and future).

* **Spanish reading:** reading comprehension activities from the book *"Cuando fui a la selva"*. Also Eva (our TA) added a video of her reading the story of *"Garbancito"* with some questions to answer about it.
