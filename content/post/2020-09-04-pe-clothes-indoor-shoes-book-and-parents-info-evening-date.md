Dear Parents/Guardians,

Senora Lane and myself have been in school this week and we are really looking forward to being there next week with the children.

In view of the building work being a bit messy, please could you ensure your children bring a **pair of indoor shoes** (which are safe enough to go downstairs and outside for a firedrill).  

We have also been asked to let you know that on PE days, Mondays for 4EE, all children are being asked to **come into school wearing suitable PE clothing and trainers**, so that they do not need to change for PE.

As you are already aware, Europa is getting a lot of new shiny classrooms and 4EE was due to have new heating and windows in the class. Due to the late start of the building work, awaiting signing of contracts by the department of education, 4EE classroom will not be ready for the children.  In true creative Europa style, **a new temporary home has been found for us in the tower block** on the first floor for a week or two.  Please do bear with us as we work with this new challenge.  We still intend to have a lot of fun and learning in the first few weeks of term, in spite of not having the classroom resources we had anticipated.   

On the first day of term the children will be welcomed at the Thame Lane entrance by Teaching Assistants who will direct them to meet us, just nearby in the Playground area.  The children will find us holding a **big yellow smiley Welcome 4EE sign**.  We will wait until the whole class is present before we show the children the way to the new temporary classroom.  If your child is coming early with an older sibling, please tell them to come and find us in the playground, not the classroom,  so that we can take everyone safely up as a whole class.  

To start the term with some sharing of what we love, please ask your child to **bring in a favourite book to read** - one Spanish and one English if you have both at home - if not, just one they would love to read.

We will be holding a **parents information evening on Tuesday 22nd September from 6pm - 7pm online** to let you know more about what 4EE will be learning this year and how you can help support your child.  Please do keep this time free if you can, it would be lovely to see you all on that evening.

There will be **no homework coming home for the first three weeks** of term as we informally assess where the children’s learning is, after such a long break from school.  We will be taking time to help the children feel at ease together and excited about learning in school again.

A parents information evening will be held on Tuesday 22nd September from 6pm - 7pm online to let you know more about what 4EE will be learning this year and how you can help support your child.  Please do keep this time free if you can, it would be lovely to see you all on that evening.

In the meantime, we are really excited to see the children and to welcome our new class member, Eve Gilmore.  Here's to next week, together again after so long.

Warmest wishes,

Mrs Cook and Señora Lane
