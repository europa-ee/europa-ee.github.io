Dear 3EE parents,

It has been wonderful to see some of the great projects children are getting up to, whether that's baking flapjacks, sewing bags, improving spellings or writing amusing adverts that promise the world - some offered a free delux cauldron and in one case a miracle cure for Covid also guaranteed you a mansion (definitely one for day dreams)! 

It would be lovely to hear from you or your children if you haven't been in touch for a few weeks - just a little note to let me know they are ok or if they need some help with a particular topic. I may be able to recommend a teaching resource or video that could help explain something or just provide a bit of reassurance.

Please find below the email I have just sent to the children. Do let me know if you are able to help with collating the newspaper articles to create a class newspaper. The link to the shared folders is:

On a wider note, I am joint IT coordinator for primary (with Mr Tebbit-Scales) and would like to better integrate IT into the children's skills development. I would be interested to know your thoughts on what key IT skills or programs you think children should be learning to equip them for the future. Please do get in touch if you have any thoughts on this.

With all best wishes,

Ruthy Trevitt
