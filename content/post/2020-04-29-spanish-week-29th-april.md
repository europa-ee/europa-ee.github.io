Dear parents

This week in Spanish we will looking at the following:

* **Spanish:** verbs in the past tense. Read, understand and recite the poem "las plantas".

* **Reading:** the story "Juan y las habichuelas mágicas" and some activities related to it. We will also start reading the book "Cuando fui a la selva". We will read half this week and the other half next week as the text on each page is not very long.

* **Writing:** They have "diario de cuarentena" in the "material" section in Google classroom to fill in every week. They will write what they have been doing during that week.

* **Ortography/Spelling:** the sound "j"

* **DoW:** The Spring "La primavera"

* **Art:** Colour in a landscape using the stippling technique.

They can also revise more contents using the app **"learningapps"** which is in the material section in Google classroom. They only need to create an account and I will be able to follow their progress.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Have a nice week.

Sofia
