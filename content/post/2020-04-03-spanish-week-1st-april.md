Dear parents

I hope everyone is keeping well.

This week we will be looking at the following:

* Maths: To learn time table 3, practise multiplications

* Spanish: prepositions of place. How to say and write where things are and what is in a town.

* Reading: How we celebrate Easter in Spain - spanish traditions.

* DoW: places in town. Give directions

* Art: Easter crafts

Thank you for all your support with this. I know it's quite challenging especially if some of you are working but all your help at the moment in this matter is very much appreciated.

As always, please let me know if you have any questions or you are finding something difficult to do. I'm always happy to help.

Sofia
