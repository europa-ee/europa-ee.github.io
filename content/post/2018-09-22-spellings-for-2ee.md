Dear Parents

Please find below the spellings for next Thursday’s spelling test in Class 2EE.   

1.	one
2.	two
3.	three
4.	four
5.	five
6.	six
7.	seven
8.	eight
9.	nine
10.	ten

The children completed a spelling assessment yesterday and I will be marking it over the weekend so that we can provide differentiated levels of spellings from next week.

Apologies for the delay in these reaching you, I thought schoolbase had sent this to you previously. Next week I’ll ensure these reach you on Wednesday so that your child has a full week’s notice.

Wishing you a relaxing weekend with your lovely children.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
