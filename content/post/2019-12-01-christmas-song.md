Dear parents

Please see below the link for the Christmas song that we are practising in class for the concert, in case someone can't find it. It can be found on youtube under the name "Campana sobre campana, Juana, Villancico Clasico (Animado) - Canticuentos.

I also asked them that if they have small bell/sleigh bell it would be good if they could bring it with them for the song. 

Thanks

Sofia
