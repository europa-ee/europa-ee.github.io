Dear Parents,

Your children have written owl books, multiplied with arrays, painted with straws, laid footprint traps, explored habitats, learnt about Judaism and more this week. They’ve been busy!  

On Thursday we visited the Library and the children were invited to take a book home. I have a list of the books they have borrowed. There is no pressure at all for the children to read the books, they may enjoy you reading to them or they may just want to dip in. It is really just to introduce them to the wealth on offer in the school library. Please could they bring the book back next Thursday either to renew or return?

It seems that Schoolbase was overloaded with copies of a large newsletter last week and ate my email to you. There must be a children’s deity stealing homework. Apologies, hopefully this will reach you tonight.

This week’s spellings are: 

1. blue 

2. true

3. glue

4. Tuesday 

5. new

6. few

7. grew

8. flew

9. parents 

10. Christmas 

Forest schools is getting very chilly, so please do ensure that your children wear hats and gloves next week, along with thick layers.  

It is a great pleasure to see the children writing such wonderful books and still curiously questioning and exploring things.  

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
