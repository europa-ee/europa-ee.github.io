Dear 3EE parents,

Thank you for your good wishes and concern. Sofia and I are sending books home to children today so those self isolating can access the class work. 

English side: I have sent all children home with their maths workbooks as well as some other workbooks and exercise books. All books can stay at home for the time being in case schools close and then we will use them for our remote lessons. Meanwhile whilst school remains open children coming to school need to keep bringing their power maths pupil workbook B in each day so that we can work in it. 

From next week onwards all work for each day will appear on google classroom - please do not expect an email as well as this may not be possible in the time constraints.

Many thanks for your support,

Ruthy Trevitt
