Dear 3EE parents,

If you would like your child to borrow a glockenspiel overnight to practise for our Christmas concert please email me, r.trevitt@europaschool.uk to confirm this and I will allow them to take it home. It must be returned the next day so that other children can have a chance to borrow it in turn. Also we need ALL the glockenspiels in school for rehearsing  as we will be doing a short practice each day and there are only just enough for one between two children. If you want to help your child practise please be aware that the glockenspiel part is playing the chords which accompany silent night (not the melody). For the purposes of singing along the starting note for the melody is the E below middle C (this prevents the children from having to sing too high). The parts have only been labelled girl and boy to make it easy to ensure children only have to practise one part each time as they are paired boy-girl for the rehearsals. The chords are played on the first note of the bar. We will perform the other carol we learnt, “On Christmas night”, in our classroom after the concert. 

Many thanks,

Ruthy Trevitt
