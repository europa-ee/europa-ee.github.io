Hola a todos,

This week you can see in the yellow book two new pages: 
1. Song about "La señorita Z" and picture of "La enfermera C". This two letters have the same sound (like a snake), when Z goes with a, u, o and when C goes with e and i. 
Song about "La señorita Z": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HZsQylt8xE
Song about "La enfermera C": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPeWlEtyx24

2. You will see the letters we have seen. They can tell you who is who in the story, whats happen in the story, words which contain those letters... If they don´t remember the story. You can watch each story (cuento) and song (canción) if you type in google: "Letrilandia" and the letter you want to watch plus story or song, for example if you want to watch the story of P you have to type: "Letrilandia el panadero P cuento". If you want to watch the song, you should type: "Letrilandia el panadero P canción". 
The same with the others letters. 

In relation with homework for this holidays you will see different words where they have to write it with the article "la, el, los, las" before. We have been working on it this term. In the other side two maths exercise (missing a number, colouring the answer).

Any doubt do not hesitate to ask me.

Many thanks for this two years with your little ones, it has been a pleasure to see them grow. I really like the video you have made it, muchas gracias :)

I hope you all have "unas felices vacaciones de Semana Santa".

Saludos,
Srta María
