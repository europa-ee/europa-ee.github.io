Dear 3EE parents,

If you would like to help on any of the remaining trips please let me know. Two of them are just morning trips rather than the whole day. We currently have need of:

One more adult for Narnia at Dorchester Abbey on Tuesday 3rd March 9:00-13:15 

Three adults for the Trinity Church, Abingdon, Easter Experience on Thursday 26th March 9:00-11:30

One more adult (ideally with some Spanish language) for Beale Park (a wildlife park) on Tuesday 12th May 9:00-15:00 

Three adults for Abingdon Museum and nature trip which will be on a Thursday in June, most likely the 11th June but possibly the 4th.

If you are able to do more than one of these dates please let me know, we will of course try and share round the trips fairly but we do need to ensure we have sufficient adults to supervise when off site.

Many thanks,

Ruthy Trevitt and Sofia Morton
