Dear 3EE parents,

It is sad that we cannot see you and your children in school but we do welcome you back to term on Monday. A few changes have been made to the way English work will appear on Google classroom thanks to the helpful feedback from parents and children.

Work will be set out a little bit differently for Mondays-Wednesdays. It will all appear the Saturday before the week starts so if you want a chance to print any of it the weekend before you can. 

**English**
I will just assign one English lesson on each of those days which will usually include some grammar work and comprehension at some point in the week. Sometimes we will use our comprehension books so please don't fill those in when children fancy it. If you ever want extra English activities just choose some from the resources for that day or choose a reading journal activity or something from the grammar folder.

**Maths** 
Each day will have one maths assignment with 2 lessons (sets of pages). If you can, please watch the videos for each maths lesson on white rose home learning. I will give the page numbers in the Green Power maths book. Just spend 30 minutes on each topic (set of pages). The questions get harder as you go through the pages so it's ok if you don't finish them all in 30 minutes, just move on to the next topic so that you have had an understanding of each topic. You could space out maths lessons and just do one maths lesson a day Mon-Fri. Also on the white rose home learning site there is a link to be able to access the green power maths textbooks which accompany the workbooks you have at home. These provide another way to explain the topic. And the BBC bitesize are producing material to match the white rose plans so you can go on their website if you need more resources or activities.

Please email a picture of something your child has enjoyed doing over the holidays and I will aim to put together a presentation to share with the class so they can see what each other has been up to and maintain a sense of being part of one united class, albeit learning apart at the moment. 

Thank you so much to all parents for being so supportive of your children and the staff at Europa School, especially to those who have provided technical help and lessons and group activities - it is great to be so well resourced.

Warm regards and enjoy the rest of the weekend,

Ruthy Trevitt
