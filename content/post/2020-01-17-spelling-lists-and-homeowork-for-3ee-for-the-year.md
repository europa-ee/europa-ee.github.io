Dear 3EE parents,

Please find attached the spelling lists for the year. Each Monday we will test we will test 10 common exception words and 10 words which follow the spelling rule for that week. Some weeks the rule is 'common exception words' so the children will have an additional 10 CE words which are listed in the table and stuck in their homework books. Due to an error made last term we will test aut week 5 and 6 words when we would expect to do spr week 5 and 6. 

The exception is 18th May when we will test all 50 common exception words (broken up into two spelling tests of 25 to aid concentration) from the list so that we can look at how children are getting on with these key words and highlight any we need to work on as a class and as individuals.

The other ongoing homework on the English side is for the children to master their times tables. This can be done using timestables rockstars, you can use the sheets which children can stick in their homework books (these are not compulsory - just an aid to learning), cards and other online games and physical games. Due to the need to find time to read in Spanish too and the importance of these key skills of reading, spelling and timestables (which underpin many maths topics) I do not want to overload the children with any additional tasks each week.

Many thanks for your ongoing support of your children and the 3EE staff team.

Best wishes,
Ruthy Trevitt
