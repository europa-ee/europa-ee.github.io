Dear parents

I hope this email finds everyone well. As I mentioned at parents evening, for children that finish reading the class book quickly and would like to read a longer book, I would suggest some books from this website:

More difficult reading (8- 10 years old): [link](https://www.edelvives.com/es/Catalogo/configurador-lecturas?bsqEdades=3-&bsqIdis=1-&bsqTipProp=1-2-3-&bsqEtapaTexto=undefined&bsqCursoTexto=undefined&bsqAsignaturaTexto=undefined&bsqProyectoTexto=undefined&bsqCCAATexto=undefined&pageSize=12&pageIndex=0)

Less difficult reading (6- 8 years old): [link](https://www.edelvives.com/es/Catalogo/configurador-lecturas?bsqEdades=11-&bsqIdis=1-&bsqTipProp=1-2-3-&bsqEtapaTexto=undefined&bsqCursoTexto=undefined&bsqAsignaturaTexto=undefined&bsqCCAATexto=undefined&pageSize=12&pageIndex=0)

They are really good as they have lots of activities and resources on the internet for each book. Also, the books with **'Ta - Tum'** option (please see below the icon in blue) have an interactive app with extra resources based on the book that we can also use in the class and at home. I think they would be very engaging for the children.

If you use the link above it shows all books that have an activity book and some of them have the **'Ta-Tum'** app too. If you decide to get some of them, please let me know which ones and I will plan the activities for them.

Thanks in advance.

Sofia
