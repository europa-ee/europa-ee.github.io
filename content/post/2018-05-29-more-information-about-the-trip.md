Queridos padres,

I forgot to tell you the following:

Children will need to bring a small backpack on the day, where they can keep their lunch (own pack lunch or picnic provided by the canteen regarding your child's lunch routine at school) and their bottle of water.

If the weather forecast looks to be good you may also want to provide them with a hat, and put some sun cream on in the morning.

We have a limited time in the park and our priority is seeing as many animals as possible, so it will not be possible to visit the Gift Shop for souvenirs. For this reason, please do not give your child any money to bring with them, as it could get lost.

Finally, I would like to add. We got already three mums who are going to help us in this trip:

- Ruth McAleavey

- Victoria Smith

- Juliana Otalora

Thank you for all your collaboration. 

Un saludo

Francisca Moreno
