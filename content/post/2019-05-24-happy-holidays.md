Dear Parents,

This is just to wish you a very happy half term with your children, who definitely deserve a rest.  They have worked incredibly hard this month. We have had a lot of fun learning together.

This week they learnt about the water cycle and made three kinds of clouds.  They wrote wonderful stories, created cubes with matchsticks, lay in the orchard and used their senses to make journey sticks. They created an amazing mural of the rainforest - photo is attached.   

Do have a lovely restful break.  Enjoy reading and playing maths games if you have time.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
