Dear parents

I've created a video for the children, which you can find in the Google classroom. I wanted to give them a message that I'm really pleased with the work that they are doing at home. Also, I show them an animal that I made with origami and I explain a bit more about the animal.

Using the video as an example, I ask them to show me the animals they made with origami or if they prefer, they can talk about their pets instead, if they have one.

In the assignment, in Google classroom, I tell them what they need to say about the animal and I've attached a powerpoint with some information that can help them to do it.

They can use powerpoint, videos, audios or pictures and displays to present it.

I hope they enjoy this project.

Have a nice week and half term break.

Sofia
