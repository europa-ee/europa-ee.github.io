Dear 3EE parents, 

In case schools are asked to close by the UK government we are making contingency plans as a school. As part of this it would be helpful to know if your child/children have access to a tablet or computer that they can use to access virtual lessons (most likely to be done via google hangouts) and can access set tasks and submit their work via google classroom. Please email Sofia and I if your children do not have a computer or tablet that they can use at home.

Most pupils have accessed google classroom in school and I have sent a letter via schoolbase with your children' log on details, please let me know if you have trouble logging into google classroom at home and I can resend the letter. 

At present the advice is to keep schools open so school will operate as normal this week.

Many thanks for your support,

Ruthy Trevitt and Sofia Morton
