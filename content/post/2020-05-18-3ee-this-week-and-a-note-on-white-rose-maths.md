Dear 3EE parents,

Firstly, apologies if you are doing white rose maths, I didn't realise they would be repeating material. I have realised it is because they are now lined up with BBC bitesize who have just started doing fractions. I will upload the alternative worksheets for White Rose maths onto google classroom as soon as I get chance which will hopefully be later this afternoon. The topic is addition and subtraction of 3 digit numbers. The videos for the lessons are available here: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/White Rose Maths-Alternative Plan-EC1C24?logo=Adobe Acrobat Reader&style=for-the-badge)](https://wrm-13b48.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Y3-Week-5-Alternative-Plan.pdf)

Secondly, I hope your children enjoy the visiting poet we have this week and the photography projects to go with the poetry composition. A big thank you to the poet Kate Wakeling and our parents William Parry and Ernest Guevarra for producing and uploading the resources.

And finally, thank you and your children for getting in touch last week or handing in work. I'm looking forward to hearing from 3EE in some way this week before we move into half term next week. After half term I have 2 projects planned for English which I hope will be fun, a newspaper for two weeks and an interactive picture book and accompanying advert which will be for the final three weeks of term.

Enjoy the good weather.

Best wishes,

Ruthy Trevitt
