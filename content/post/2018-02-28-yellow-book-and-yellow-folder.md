Hola a todos,

This week I am sending home the yellow book with a nice song about the seasons:

On the other hand I have sent homework in the yellow folder. They have to check how it is the weather every day and they should write the full sentence in Spanish. If they need it, they can look in the yellow book (last week entry), I am sure it will help them to do it.

Saludos,

Srta Maria
