Whether they are at home or in school, or a mix of both, you can get your whole class excited to write with [Brain Swap](https://www.youngwriters.co.uk/competitions/KS2/brain-swap!

Asking your pupils to write from someone else’s point of view is a fun challenge that can ignite their imagination, help them practise empathy, and of course, have fun!

Whether they want to spend the day in the football boots of a Premier League superstar or launch themselves on a space voyage, with [Brain Swap](https://www.youngwriters.co.uk/competitions/KS2/brain-swap) anything is possible.

If a fun theme isn’t enough, there are prizes up for grabs and the chance to be published, giving pupils added purpose to their writing. Get Europa School UK involved today, it’s a no brainer!

And… there are ready-made resources which can be used either at home or in the classroom!

Don’t worry if parents can’t print the worksheet at home as pupils can write their poem on A4 paper or even type it.

Find out more here!

P.S. If poetry isn’t right for your pupils at the moment, check out Ridiculous Writers instead!
