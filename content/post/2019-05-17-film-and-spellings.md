Dear Parents,

The children made a film this week about the rainforest – please do take the time to watch it here

We had fun cooking pizzas on the Forest Schools fire, creating stories, measuring our feet and writing about the seasons.

Please do listen to your children reading aloud to you this week.  This week’s spellings are: 

1.	who

2.	would 

3.	could

4.	should

5.	many

6.	again

7.	whole (pizza)

8.	hole (in the wall)

9.	fast

10.	because

I know that some of these are repeats, but they are still not always being included in free writing.

Many thanks for all your help at home.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
