Dear parents
 
In Spanish this week we will be learning the following:
 
* **Spanish:** augmentative and diminutive.
 
* **Reading:** Review of the book "para hacer un pastel de manzana" or another Spanish book they have been reading. Reading "voy a casa" and activities.
 
* **Orthography:** Dictation with the sounds *g* and *j*
 
* **DoW:** Daily routines
 
* **Maths:** Revise contents from this year. I've sent two files (one is more challenging). They can start doing this now and continue working on it throughout the summer.
 
* **Art:** Create your own aquarium. The website below shows you how to make it, they are in Spanish but there are pictures to illustrate how to make it. They need to write the names of the animals in Spanish.

Have a nice week.
