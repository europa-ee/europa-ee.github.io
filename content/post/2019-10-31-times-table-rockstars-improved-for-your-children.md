Dear 3EE parents,

I have just improved the set up of Times tables rockstars so that all pupils have the 2, 5, 10 and 3 x table questions available on their games. Please have a go on this website and see what you think - our free trial as a school ends in a week and we need to evaluate the service to see if it is a good idea for the school to subscribe. I am sorry I did not get chance to update the children's times tables until now. If your child is already quite proficient in more tables than the 2,5,10 and 3 I have left them on automatic mode so they will continue to see the other times tables that they know, or are learning.

Many thanks,

Ruthy Trevitt
