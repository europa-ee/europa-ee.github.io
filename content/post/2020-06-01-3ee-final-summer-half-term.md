Dear 3EE parents,

Welcome to the final summer half term. I am very sad not to see your children in school or yourselves at pick up but I am very grateful for your support and encouragement. 

Maths will continue with relevant pages from Power Maths to ensure curriculum coverage. I have also ensured that the white rose sheets available will cover the rest of the curriculum that has not yet been studied in school or during home learning. This does mean that on many weeks the accompanying white rose videos will not be available as they are scheduled for weeks where we will already have finished school or are not yet available. However the worksheets and answer sheets will be there for you.

I have planned some interesting English projects that I hope your children will enjoy collaborating on. For the next two weeks we are creating our own newspaper although to make the most of this it would be great for the children's articles to be combined to make one class newspaper. This means children can share and enjoy each other's work. To this end Sofia has kindly created a shared folder where you or your children can post their articles. Hopefully one or two parents can collaborate to create a whole class newspaper out of these articles. Please get in touch if you feel you can help with this.

For the final three weeks children will create their own interactive picture book based on the Jolly Postman books. Again it would be lovely to share these but there is no pressure to. If your child would like to share their work there is a folder for this in the shared drive. 

If you share work you are giving consent for other children and their families to view it so if you would prefer not to share then please just submit it using google classroom. The link to the folder for sharing work is below and I will be sharing this with the children's own email addresses too (asking them to check with you if they can share their work):

Lastly I am sorry to say that Louise and I will not be able to provide as much feedback on google classroom as we have up until now as we will be working many more days in school with other classes. We hope that the chance for the children to share their work with each other will allow some positive peer feedback. It would be great for the children to continue to submit work if this helps motivate them and I am looking forward to the sharing of their English projects.

With warm regards and very best wishes,

Ruthy Trevitt
