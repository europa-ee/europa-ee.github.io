Dear Parents, 

Thanks so much to all of you who were able to join us this afternoon for our class party.  The children loved having you there to see their song and film.  As promised, here is the link to the beautiful film the children made: [https://spark.adobe.com/video/LxWTNfe6VfFCJ](https://spark.adobe.com/video/LxWTNfe6VfFCJ)

Do ask them about their assembly which they performed in front of the whole of KS1 today - it was great.

Thanks too for the really moving `"Inspiring Jar"` you gave me.  I have just started to read the lovely messages from the children.  I will treasure it.  I have really appreciated their company this year, they are inspiring.

It would be great if you could send a bag in tomorrow with your child so that they can bring home their books for you to enjoy.

Warmest wishes to you all,

Liz Cook
