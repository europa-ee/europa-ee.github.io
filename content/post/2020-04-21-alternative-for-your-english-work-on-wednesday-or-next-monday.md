Hello,

If you are not so keen on the diary activities or the English that will be set for next Monday you might like to watch the video (link is below) by Mrs Elliott (English teacher in 3DE) and have a go at the questions which I will also put on this email. I will make it an assignment in the optional afternoon projects too so you can submit work there. It is all about chicks growing and hatching.

It may be possible for Ernest (Kaveh's Dad) to put them on the 3EE website so that they are available for a bit longer than 7 days but I am not sure about that so if you are keen on this maybe watch the videos this week.

Best wishes,

Mrs Trevitt
