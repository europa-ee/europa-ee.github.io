Dear 3EE parents,

A quick update to say thank you for the wonderful performances of poetry you have sent me, they have been amusing for all the right reasons - your children have clearly practised them and it sounds like it was a popular activity which is great to hear.

If you are following the white rose maths you will notice that from next week the worksheets and answers will no longer appear on their website as they are making them only available to subscription customers. Fear not though as the school now has a subscription so I will post the worksheets and answers for whiterose as a separate 'assignment' each week and have already prepared for week 3 and week 4.

Lastly a quick reminder that if you are opting (due to time and device constraints) not to upload documents/pictures of your children's work that is fine but if that is the case please could you send Sofia and I a quick email once a week to let us know how your child is getting on in Spanish, maths and English. The children are welcome to 'return' or 'hand in' assignments without attaching documents/pictures so that they can electronically tick it off their to-do list, however Sofia and I would need to hear from the child or parents via email once a week if they are not attaching any work. We do not want to burden you (so no need to write a lot in your email or to hand in every assignment) it is just that we continue to have a responsibility for the education of the children in 3EE so would love to know how they are getting on.

Lastly please find attached a demonstration of division methods for larger numbers. I have illustrated how children might set out their working and also explained the methods. At this stage I would not encourage children to use the bus stop method but to use the number facts they know as this encourages flexibility of thinking and they will begin to work out more efficient means of using their number knowledge as they go. For example when doing 72/3 they might realise that if 30/3 is 10 they could just partition 72 into 60 and 12 and know that 60/3 is 20. Please do have a look at the attached methods. I will also email them to the children as a reminder.

Many thanks,

Ruthy Trevitt
