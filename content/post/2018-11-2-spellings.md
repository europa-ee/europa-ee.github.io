Dear Parents,

Many thanks for supporting your child in learning this weekâ€™s words to learn to spell: 

1. see 
2. green 
3. week 
4. sea 
5. each 
6. read 
7. find 
8. kind 
9. mind 
10. behind

Thanks too to all those of you who are reading on a nightly basis with the children, it makes such a difference.  Please do try and ensure that English reading books come back into school each week on a Wednesday so that we can change them for a new one.  The children are becoming really motivated readers and writers.  Do ask them about the Magic Unicorn book we read.

Have a wonderful weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
