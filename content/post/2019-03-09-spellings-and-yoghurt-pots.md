Dear Parents,

We had a great World Book Day filled week this week and the children all developed their own imaginary characters, which they illustrated and described for the school Book Day competition.  They planted beans to grow hydroponically on the window and identified plants in Forest Schools.  In Maths, they played with fractions by folding paper and remembered that they are equal parts of a whole.

Next week is Science Week and we are looking forward to using microscopes and exploring animal behaviour with visitors.  Please could you send in an old, small, clean yoghurt pot on Wednesday, so that we can grow some cress?

Spellings for this week are:

for

short

born

horse

morning

saw

draw

yawn

crawl

shawl

Have a lovely weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
