Dear Parents,

We have had fun this week making food chains, finding out about left over M&Ms, writing colour poems, learning about Hanukkah, playing Guess Who and making a Forest School Canopy.  

Words to learn for spelling this week are: 

1. fly

2. sky

3. pie

4. mice

5.high

6.might

7.night

8.tights

9.sigh

10.sight

You child has brought home some of these on light bulbs to play with.

A date for your diary - 2EE will be visiting Millets Falconry Centre on 28th March all day. If you can join us as a volunteer, please let Christopher's Mum Tatiana know. We are hoping for four volunteers.

Also for your diary, please join me if you can for an information session about the end of year assessments, which the children will not know about, but you might want to. I will answer questions and giving a short presentation about it at 5pm on 27th February.  

Wishing you a very happy weekend. I am attaching a photo of the wonderful canopy the children made today for you, well as their display about appreciating differences.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
