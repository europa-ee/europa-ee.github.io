Dear Parents

As discussed at the meeting we are sending you the presentation that we shared with you and the list of sample words, which can be used for practise at home. The words include all the sounds that we have covered this year - the phase 3 and 5 sounds.

Unfortunately the presentation becomes slightly corrupted on saving, however all the information can be read. 
We are aware that many of you were unable to attend so we hope that this will be useful. 

If you have any further questions please do contact your class teacher.

Kind regards

Year 1 teachers
