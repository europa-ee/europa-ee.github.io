Queridos Padres de 1EE,

Mainly I am writing you to let you know that everything in 1EE is going very well. The children are improving a lot in all the areas. it will be nice if you know some of the Spanish songs we are listening until now. How you know the songs are a big motivating and resource to learn a language.

Secondly, for next term in Math, we are going to introduce the time, so I have thought to make a clock with the children. Therefore I would appreciate if the first week after this half term the children could bring  Cheese triangle box, preferable card or plastic (no wood). I will show you which type of box each one they will need to make it.

Finally, after this half term, I will send you all the academic information about the last term in 1EE.

I wish you a lovely half term.

Un cordial saludo

Francisca Moreno
