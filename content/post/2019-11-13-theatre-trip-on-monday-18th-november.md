Dear parents,

This is a gentle reminder that we have a year 3 visit to the Theatre this coming Monday. Please remember to give your child a packed lunch which we will be eating when we return to school. 

If your child suffers from travel sickness please send an email to your class teacher to let them know.

Could parent helpers please sign in at the main reception and then make your way to the classroom to meet up with the teacher and read the risk assessment before the class departs for the trip.

Many thanks,

Year 3 teachers
