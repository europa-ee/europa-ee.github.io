Hola a todos,

This week I have sent in the yellow book words written with *"y / ll"*. Although they have the same sound your child should write them in the correct way. Read with them and you can ask them to write you different words on a paper.
Another activity you can do is to read it to them and your child can find the picture or opposite (They read it to you and you can find the picture).

I have sent **"Letrilandia"** to read this sounds (pag 41,43), but if they would like will be great to review previous ones. (audio attached)

* pag 41: La y griega - [download audio](/audio/pag 41 La y griega.wma)

* pag 43: El portero LL - [download audio](/audio/Pag 43 El portero LL.wma)

They haven´t watched the songs and I am sure they would love to do it, here you can see the links:

`LL`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVm-pD8__8E

`Y`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acRgFPiqCa4

On the other hand, in maths we have seen `2D` and `3D` shapes, you will see them in the yellow book too.

Have a nice end of the week,

Saludos,

Srta Maria
