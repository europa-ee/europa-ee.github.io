Dear Parents,

The children have worked so hard this week I think we should not do a spelling test next week.

It was lovely to see some of you at the concert on Monday and on Wednesday evening.  Many thanks for your generosity to Snr Ruiz and I - I have some very lovely presents to put under the tree.  

Some of you asked me to send you a copy of the tricky words which your child should be able to spell by the end of the year in their own writing. Please find it attached.  

The children asked me to send you this maths games which we enjoyed on the carpet today.

Please also find a photo collage of their fun in forest schools and with our engineering for elves and Santa.

Happy weekend to you all.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
