Dear parents

I hope you are all well and have managed to enjoy the Easter break with your families.

We are in the last term now and I'm going to let you know what we will be learning during this first half of the summer term.

* **Spanish:** actions in the past, means of transport, say how to go to school, orientation (left-right), a poem, antonyms-opposites, family nouns of animals, collective nouns, comparison (more than, less than, as as), describe an object. Ortography sound "j".

* **Spanish reading:** This term we will work through non-fiction texts, reading about the life cycle of animals and finding information about them. Also we will read some books like: "la semillita", "Jack y las habichuelas mágicas" and "Cuando fui a la seva".They will start reading the book they took home before school closed between the third and fourth week prior to half term and then do some comprehension activities. I will let you know when this starts.

* **Spanish writing:** They will write a diary about what they have been doing each week in "diario de cuarentena" (lockdown diary), for which I will add to "materials" into the Google classroom. Also they will search and write the information they find about animals (habitat, food, type of animal,...) on a worksheet.

* **DoW:** This term we will focus on life cycle of plants and animals.

* **Maths:** Keep practising time tables (5, 10, 6, 7, 8, 9), problem solving and the time.

* **Art:** We will learn about a famous Spanish artist "Picasso" and we will create our own cubist portrait inspired by Pablo Picasso. 
Drawing landscapes using the stippling technique, collage, origami and symmetries.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks for your help. 

Sofia
