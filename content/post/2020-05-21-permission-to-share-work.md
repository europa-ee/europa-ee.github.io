Dear parents

The English and Spanish classes would like to share with everyone the amazing work that the children are doing at home.

Please let me know if you are happy for Ruthy and I to share the pictures, videos and pieces of work your children have done with the rest of the class.

I would be greatful if you could let me know by the end of this week.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks

Sofia
