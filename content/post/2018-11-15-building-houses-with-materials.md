Dear Parents, 

I thought you might like to see some pictures from the building work today.  The children worked immensely hard responding to a brief, designing, budgeting, building, testing and adapting their houses.  They learnt a lot about working in teams, keeping within a timeframe and learning from mistakes.  I hope they mentioned it to you.  They should be very proud of their hard work.  Attached are two compilation photos, excuse the mix being a little rushed.  

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
