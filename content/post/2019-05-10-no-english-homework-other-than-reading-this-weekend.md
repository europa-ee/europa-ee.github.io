Dear Parents,

Your children have worked super hard this week and deserve a weekend off - so no English homework this week other than reading their book to you.  Hopefully this will give you time to enjoy reading a book for pleasure together.

We had a wonderful day today celebrating our international links.  The children made complex flags showing all the different countries they felt connected with.  They found the countries on a map and made a collaborative jigsaw of the whole world.  In English this week they chose their own characters and illustrated and described them, inspired by Beatrix Potter.  In Maths they showed their mighty reasoning powers and played games.

Thanks to all of you who helped make such wonderful costumes and especially to those who helped in the Schumann Hall today.  It was a fantastic show of cultures â€“ inspiring.  I feel very lucky to be part of such a multinational community.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
