Dear year 3EE parents, 

We are pleased to let you know there will be a school trip to Science Oxford on Thursday 30th January to carry out some hands on experiments and observe other scientific phenomena. [https://scienceoxford.com/centre/visitor-information/](https://scienceoxford.com/centre/visitor-information/)

The coaches will depart promptly at 9am. Children will require a packed lunch and water bottle that day, please ensure they have a small rucksack or bag to carry this in. 

We will need two parent helpers for the trip so let me know if you are free and would like to come.

Many thanks,

Sofia
