Good evening ,

I am Señora Lane and I will be teaching your son/daughter this year in Spanish.

I sent your son/daughter an invitation to join our google classroom in Spanish.

As I would like the children to avoid sharing resources as much as they can, I would prefer them to bring their own glue stick. 

More information will follow soon.

Thank you very much for your support.

Señora Lane
