Queridos padres,

This week I have sent the song of the “Real Family” from “Letrilandia” in the yellow book, here you can watch the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViKdsqvDgc

They may tell you already a story with this letters. It is a “Real Family” and they are different characters. If you go to that link, you can watch in the menu in the right hand side, different songs per letter. I am sure they would like to watch them, at the moment we have seen `u`, `o`, `a`, `e`, `i` and `p`.

Each character has different stories. Here I have added you the link per story for you to put it at home during Christmas. They have listened to them in the class but it will be good for them to listen and relating them, because after Christmas we will carry on with different letters.
