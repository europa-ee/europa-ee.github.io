Dear Parents and Guardians,

Thank you for working so hard to help your children learn their spellings last week.  We had a test in class today and they were thrilled to share with each other the ingenious ways they had practised.

For the coming week the spellings are the words for numbers from eleven to twenty.  

* eleven
* twelve
* thirteen
* fourteen
* fifteen
* sixteen
* seventeen
* eighteen
* nineteen
* twenty

Have fun with your children in rainbow letters, air writing, in the car ... the test is in school next Thursday.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
