Dear Parents,

The children have had a busy week creating  habitat posters, playing with 5 x tables, making handprints in the forest, dividing up cookies, modelling animals in clay and thinking from inside the head of a robin, crab, frog or squirrel. The classroom is full of their wonderful creations.  

This weekâ€™s words to learn for spellings are: 

1.	tie

2.	pie

3.	cry

4.	try

5.	dry

6.	cried

7.	tried

8.	every

9.	everybody 

10.	even 

Have a lovely restful weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
