Dear Parents,

We would like to invite you to a short meeting at **6-6:30 pm** on **Wednesday the 25th of April** regarding the **statutory Year 1 phonics screening** which will take place in early June. We plan to meet in the **Drama Studio at the bottom of the large tower block**.

At the meeting we will outline the nature of the the screening program and suggest ways that you can support your child with their phonics.

Yours sincerely,

Year 1 English teachers
