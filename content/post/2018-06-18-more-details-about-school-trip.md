Queridos padres,

Tomorrow is our year1 joint end-of-year school trip to Cotswold Wildlife Park, Tuesday 19th of June.

Children will need to bring a small backpack on the day, where they can keep their lunch (picnic provided by the canteen regarding your child's lunch routine at school) and their bottle of water. 

As the weather forecast looks to be good you may want to provide them with a hat, and put some sun cream on in the morning (before school).

We have a limited time in the park and our priority is seeing as many animals as possible, so it will not be possible to visit the Gift Shop for souvenirs. For this reason, please do not give your child any money to bring with them, as it could get lost. 

We will be leaving school at 9:15 am in the morning, and arriving back just before 3pm, so drop off in the morning and pick up in the afternoon will be as normal.

Un cordial saludo

Francisca Moreno
