Dear All,

What a joy to meet your children! We have had fun.

There is a letter in your child's bag for you tonight and an English reading book.  If you feel the reading level is too low, because your child has improved over the holidays, please let us know.  We will be checking in with each child in the coming week or so.  

Looking forward to meeting you all soon.  Please keep the evening of **Wednesday 19th September** free from **18.00 - 18.30** if you can.  Sr Ruiz and I would love to meet you then at the Parents Information evening in class.  

Warmest wishes

Liz
