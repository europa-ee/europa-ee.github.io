Dear parents,

White Rose Maths, which we have used all year, have put together some fantastic home learning resources for your children. From tomorrow there will be a live lesson where children can ask questions and get some help, use twitter at 10am  #MathsEveryoneCanAtHome  to access it. 

It may be helpful for your child to watch the video tutorial and try the worksheet before the live lesson, find them (and the worksheet answers) at [https://whiterosemaths.com/homelearning/](https://whiterosemaths.com/homelearning/)

If your child finds it difficult to understand the lesson they could also look at the White Rose home learning lesson for year 2 which will be on the same topic at an easier level.

Apologies for emailing at the weekend I just didn't want the children to get out of sync or miss the chance of the live lesson at 10am on [Twitter #MathsEveryoneCanAtHome](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MathsEveryoneCanAtHome?src=hash). We had already started covering these topics so if you choose to begin on Tuesday with lesson 2 it will not be a problem.

Maths at 'virtual' Europa School UK will be a combination of these White Rose lessons and a little bit of calculation practice in Spanish and English (using the books sent home and TT rockstars). More details will follow after our planning day tomorrow. 

Please check out the skeleton ideas for creative afternoon projects on google classroom and send us any relevant resources or ideas to help flesh them out. Projects can all be done through the medium of Spanish or English. Children can share project pictures and ideas as we go along. 

Kind regards,

Ruthy and Sofia
