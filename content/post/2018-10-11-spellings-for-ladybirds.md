Dear Parents, 

Thanks for all your help in supporting your child's learning of spellings last week, they were thrilled to show their learning in class today.

The words to learn for the coming week are: 
1. made
2. came
3. same
4. take 
5. safe 
6. five 
7. ride 
8. door 
9. poor 
10. floor

As you can see, this week the pattern is words containing the vowel phonemes using split digraphs a_e and i_e.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3oA4wfUBak is a film they enjoy watching about split digraphs ending in e.
Last three words are common exception words.

Thanks for all your help practising these words in the week ahead.  We will have a test next Thursday.

We had fun today learning to go backwards up a number line, drawing leaves, sitting still like frogs and reading poetry with alliteration.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
