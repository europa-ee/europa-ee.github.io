Dear Parents,

**Science week** has been fun! The children used microscopes on Wednesday, assisted by a research scientist Oxford University. On Thursday they learnt about animal behaviour from Lucaâ€™s Mum and loved hearing about positive rewards helping rescue animals learn to behave. In Maths they have made 3D shapes and in English they have learnt how to tell the Chinese story of Mai Ling. Please do ask them to tell you the story.

Words to learn for this week are: 

1. air

2. fair

3. hair

4. pair

5. chair

6. dairy

7. stairs

8. fairy

9. child

10. children

Have a happy weekend.

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
