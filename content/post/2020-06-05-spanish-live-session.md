Dear parents
 
Hope all the children enjoyed the Spanish session with Eva today.
 
I'm aware that a number of children joined today's session were not registered for the meet. For future sessions, we need to create small groups, as when there are too many children on Google meet the session becomes less effective. 
 
I would kindly ask that your child only joins the lesson that they are registered for.
 
We also noticed instances of children using the chat function to chat in English or simply chat to their friends - this is not allowed in the sessions, and I would be grateful if you could remind them of this.
 
Next week, I will allocate your child (providing you have given consent) into a session and I will send an email confirming the day and time for this session.  
 
Thanks
 
Sofia
