Dear Parents,

The children are having a great day building houses for the three little pigs today.  They are working as teams to design, budget, build and test their houses to see if they can withstand the wolf's blowing.  This is why we did our spelling test early yesterday.

The spellings to learn for next week are as follows: 

1. food

2. moon 

3. school 

4. good 

5. book 

6. took 

7. wood 

8. most 

9. only 

10. both

Many thanks to those of you who are ensuring children practise at different points through the week so that the words are learnt with repetition.

Looking forward to the theatre tomorrow :).

Warmest wishes,

Liz Cook
