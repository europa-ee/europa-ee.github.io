Queridos padres de 1EE,

We are already in the fourth week of this period. And I think we are getting a good rhythm of learning. As 1EE teacher, I am following the same learning system like  Senorita Maria Castro but with some modifications that I consider beneficial with working with children.

Every week I send home homework, between math exercises, reading with Letrilandia or  yellow study notebook. I will try to send only one thing each week, because I consider that with the DVDs and a little bit of homework it is enough for the children.

My apologies for the past week for having sent the book of "Letrilandia"and not to warn you in advance of the pages to read. I considered that the children knew the last three letters we have given in class. Therefore, this week I send you again Letrilandia, then you can read the pages (54 to 67), and besides some math exercises.

Feliz semana !!

Un cordial saludo

Senorita Francisca Moreno
