Dear 3EE parents,

Please find attached the curriculum overview for this year (also called our long term plan). There may be slight variations on this as we adapt to the interests of the children and to events.

Lastly, although dates are not confirmed yet we should be taking part in the following experiences and trips:

Visit from the Abingdon museum to look at the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s

Visit from a children's book author

Trip to the pantomime

Trip to the Easter Experience at Trinity Church in Abingdon

Trip to the Oxford Science Centre

Visit from the Spanish Embassy (yet to be confirmed)

Trip to Abingdon museum with a nature walk if the weather allows.

Trip to Beale Park for the children to present their Spanish non-fiction writing

We also hope to carry out other special interest half days through the year. For example last year the children had a Divali afternoon exploring how it is celebrated and a time to design, create, advertise and sell their own products.

If you are interested in helping on a trip or a special interest half day please could you let Sofia and I know which days you can be available and it would also be helpful to know if you are a fluent Spanish speaker (for example for the Beale Park trip), although this is not necessary for most trips and will not of course preclude you from helping.

Many thanks,
Ruthy Trevitt and Sofia Morton
