Dear parents,

Apologies for a second email, please could we request the children to bring in a clear photo of themselves: headshots would be perfect but any picture where we can see their lovely faces is great. We would like to make a little display about ourselves to help all the staff who work with 3EE get to know the children quickly especially as we have a violin teacher and sports coach in addition to our 2 teachers and 2 TAs. If the children could bring this in either this week or at the beginning of next week that would be ideal. It can be stored in their trays ready for us to make our display.

Many thanks,
Ruthy Trevitt and Sofia Morton
