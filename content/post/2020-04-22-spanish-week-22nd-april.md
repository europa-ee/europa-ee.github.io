Dear parents

This week in Spanish, we will be looking at the following areas:

* Grammar and writing: actions in the past (what have you done over recent days), means of transport, say how you go to, orientation (left-right)

* Reading: Book *"la semillita"*

* DoW: Life cycle of a plant.

* Maths: Time tables 5 and 10, problem solving.

Thanks for your help.

Sofia
