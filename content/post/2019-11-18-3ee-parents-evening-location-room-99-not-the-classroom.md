Dear parents,

Please come to **room 99** for parents evening appointments, not the classroom. As we will be starting appointments when the classroom is in use then all of the meetings will be in **room 99** which is in the hostel block, opposite the Thame Lane reception office. There will be a few chairs outside to wait on. 

Many thanks,

Ruthy Trevitt and Sofia Morton
