Dear 3EE parents

This week 3EE will have PSHE lessons exploring bereavement, giving children a space to pause and reflect and to ask questions. I have attached the lesson resources we will be using so that if your child is absent you have the opportunity to explore this area with them at home. The resource is taken from Child bereavement UK.

If your child would rather not be in these lessons please let me know - I have timetabled them for a time when Louise, our TA, is with us.

We will be looking at the picture books 'Badger's parting gifts' and also Michael Rosen's 'Sad Book' which, although written largely for a children's audience, I found helpful as an adult when my brother died unexpectedly 15 years ago. Online readings and pictures from Badger's Parting Gifts and the Sad Book can be found respectively:
