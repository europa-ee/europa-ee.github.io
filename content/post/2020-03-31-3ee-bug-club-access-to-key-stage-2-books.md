Dear 3EE parents,

We now have access to bug club for years3-6 and there are electronic versions of books suitable for these year groups. This is especially helpful if you want levelled books or are running out of fresh books for your children to read. Just search for 'bug club login' to find the log in page and access the e-books or follow the link below.

Your child's username is below as it does not follow the standard pattern. Passwords are all set as Esuk3ee. The school code is jk3l (the last character is a lower case letter L)

username: AS PROVIDED BY TEACHER

password: Esuk3ee

school code: jk3l

If you have any questions or can't log in please get in touch.

Many thanks,

Ruthy Trevitt
