Dear parents

I've added into the Google classroom some other materials that will help the children continue practicing their Spanish.

* Cuentos para descargar (Books to download): Here you can find a link to a website where you will see different reading books that are free to download.

* Audiocuentos (audiobooks): You will see a few links to access the free audiobooks.

* Diario de cuarentena (Lockdown diary): Here you can find a sheet where children can write about their week; what they have been doing, what they have learnt or/and enjoyed doing,... This activity is good for practising writing in Spanish and will also help them express how they are feeling.

* Learningapps website: It's a website with lots of interactive activities classified in different topics which are related to what we are learning. More activities will be added later on as we learn new topics. Children only need to access through the link I sent and then set up an account.

I hope you find this useful.

Thanks

Sofia
