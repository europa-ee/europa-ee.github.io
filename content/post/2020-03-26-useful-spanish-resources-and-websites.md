Dear parents

I just wanted to mention that there is a website that I forgot to mention on my last email, that children can use to revise contents and learn vocabulary in a fun way. It's called **linguascope**.

[https://www.linguascope.com/](https://www.linguascope.com/)

To get access you need to type:

- **Username:** europauk

- **password:** linglang

I've also added in Google classroom one folder for this where I will be adding useful resources and websites for children to use at home.

I hope this is helpful.

Sofia
