Dear parents

This week in Spanish we will be looking at the following:

* **Spanish:** reading comprehension "the life cycle of a chicken", family names of animals.

* **Ortography/Spellings:** Dictation words with the sound "j"

* **Reading:** We will finish reading "Cuando fui a la selva"

* **DoW:** the life cycle of a chicken and the time (seasons, months, days of the week, changes that occur in each season, the calendar).

* **Maths:** the time (how to say the time in Spanish) This year we will focus on how to say o'clock, quarter past, half past, quarter to.

* **Art:** We will use the technique of collage and make some creations. I've attached some examples in Google classroom.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Have a nice week.

Sofia
