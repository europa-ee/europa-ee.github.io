**Teacher:** Shibin (Leo's mum)

**Description:**

Learning Objectives:

1. To get to know artist Wassily Kandinsky and his work

2. To learn how colours play an important role in his work instead of figurative images  

3. To understand how two different colours (shades) contrast each other in the form of circles

4. To practice how to put different colour together to create a beautiful tree
 
**Lesson plan in one hour:** 

1. Introducing artist Kandinsky and a few of his abstract work composed by colours 

2. Brief introduction of Kandinsky’s renovation work leading to a most important movement in modern art history – abstractism 

3. Discussing how you feel that there is no actual image just colour to represent your feelings and ideas in a ‘abstract’ way

4. Discussing how two or more colours can be ‘combined’ together make a good contrast (with reference of Kandinsky’s circle painting and ‘tree of life’ )

5. Practice: to finish decorate a tree by composing colours together 

**Materials required:**

Different choices for materials. Some examples of children's work:

* Easy for children to make on the spot: to cut different colour papers in circles in two or three different sizes so they can be laid over each other. Don’t forget the tree trunks and branches. And a plain (or coloured) paper, and glue sticks.

* Easy for parents: just cut some plain papers in circles (can be in different sizes), children can use crayon, oil pastel or water colour / acrylic paint on them, then glue them on the tree.

* The easiest one: to ask the children draw on a plain paper by using crayon, oil pastel or water colour / acrylic paint on them, then glue them on the tree.

* They can use a A4 or A3 size of plain / colour paper, or if you like to go bigger scale, but don’t have a big paper or cardboard, they can be put on a door or a window directly (for example). It normally comes out as a very beautiful tree picture, you might like to display. 

* If you decide that they are going to work on A4 or A3 paper, and you don’t mind cutting the circles, bear in mind that size of the circle shouldn’t be too big, so they can put sufficient coloured circles on it

**More about Kandinsky**

If you like to go a bit further on Kandinsky’s abstract painting, I found couple of links online, one slides show and one video, don’t know if they can be of help.
