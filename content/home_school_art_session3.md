**Description:**

The actual meaning and interpretation of Magritte’s work can be very difficult for children to understand, so we are only learning about Magritte’s work and surrealism briefly, but use the form in his work , eg. the eye in ‘the False mirror’ to help children’s imagination and put into drawing.

Learning Objectives:

1. Getting to know artist René Magritte and a few of his works

2. Learning ‘surrealism’ briefly

3. (Most importantly) Learn to let your imagination flow even things doesn’t make sense, but can express your ideas! 

**Materials required:**

Pencil, (coloured pencils) , paper. Or if you have water resistant ink pen would be great, for in case they want to apply colours (water colours), but it doesn’t have to.
