## An Introduction to the project

For starters, if you have never read a **Jolly Postman** book by **Janet and Alan Ahlberg** then click on the link below to hear a great reading of the first book in this series. The book has a central story but also lots of lovely envelopes you get to open and fun things inside to explore.

Ok, so now itâ€™s your turn! You are going to create another book in the series, the title of this one is the Jolly Covid Postman and involves the Jolly Postman doing his rounds to deliver letters and packages to the fairy tale characters. The central story has been written, you need to create letters and other fun things to go in envelopes as part of the book. The first thing is to explore the main story a bit and then you will make a new letter or package each day. At the end of the project you will print out the book, stick on envelopes to your pages and put the fun things you have created in the correct envelopes.

## Things to do to prepare for this project:

Find some largish envelopes you can use in your book to fit in the different things you will make. Ideally they will have a triangle flap so that you can stick the back of the triangle to a page in your book, and then the front of the envelope will show on the page. You can then flip the envelope up to get the things out.

Or you could carefully stick the edges of two pieces of paper together, leave the top open and ideally cut a long triangle out of the top edge of the top piece of paper so you can get your hand in easily to take out the letters.
