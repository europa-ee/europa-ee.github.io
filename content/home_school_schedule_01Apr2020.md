**Activity:** English: Grammar

Nelson Grammar Pupil Book 3 Unit 2 - Singular and Plural

Read then do the exercises on page 8 and page 9 assigned below, "Unit 2 Singular and Plural".

Then if you still have time you can get more practice with the "support" or "extension" sheet for unit 2 in your purple grammar folder.

Extra for curious parents who love grammar or very curious pupils who like technical challenges - if you are wondering why "I" appears to take the plural form (the plural for "we" and "they" is "we like" and "they like" but the singular for he and she is "he likes" and "she likes", for the singular I thought it is "I like") and want a bit more information please go into the relevant document below. Parents with expert grammar knowledge please tell me if there are errors in the document below and I will endeavour to correct them, I have taken it from [https://www.quora.com/Why-is-I-treated-as-a-plural-subject](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-I-treated-as-a-plural-subject).

**Time:** 11.30 - 12.00

**Activity:** English creative writing

Write Mrs Trevitt a feedback email about how you have found these two weeks of English learning at home and using Google Classroom. Use your school email address. You can write it on a phone or tablet or computer, or if you have been on a screen too long this week just write me a hand written letter and send me a photo of it. My email address is [r.trevitt@europaschool.uk](mailto:r.trevitt@europaschool.uk).

Tell me what you have enjoyed about the tasks you have been set and what you don't like. Try and think about what is good about learning at home as well as telling me things you miss about learning at school. If you did it again what would you like to do more of and what would you like to do less of? What have you been doing with your free time (or project time) Mon-Wed when you have not been doing maths or English?
