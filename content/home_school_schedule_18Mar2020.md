* capital letters used to start the speech;

* punctuation to end the sentence go inside the speech marks;

Once you have practised using speech marks a bit with a grown up try the task on google classroom to add in speech marks. This is scheduled to appear on Wednesday at 8am. You are also asked to put in full stops in sensible places so that it is not one long run on sentence.
