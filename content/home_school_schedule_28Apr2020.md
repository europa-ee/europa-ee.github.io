## English

Either do:
a) Read the poem '5 minutes more' which is activity 1 and pick out the words that rhyme. Tap out the rhythm as you read it.

b) Write your own poem (activity 3), if you want a bit more help then use the extra guide Mrs Trevitt's made and attached below. OR if you prefer you could write and send me another limerick (guide attached)!

OR if you prefer you can do the BBC bitesize lesson on poetry from 24th April:
