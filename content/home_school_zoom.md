Using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) requires the installation of their Meetings client into either a mobile device (iOS or Android platforms) or a computer/laptop (Windows PC or macOS). Their Meetings client is what allows for the more advanced functionalities available with [Zoom](https://zoom.us) compared to a web-only application such as Google Meet. Once Meetings client has been installed, you can already participate in [Zoom](https://zoom.us)-hosted meetings without having to create an account with [Zoom](https://zoom.us) (unless you already have a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) account or if you want to host a meeting). 

Following is a step-by-step guide on how to get started with using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for videoconferencing on various platforms.
